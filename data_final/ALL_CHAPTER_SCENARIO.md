### CINEMATIC: INTRO #1
> It is fifteen years into the age of S’jet

> Fifteen years since the warlord Makaan met his end at Balcora...

> ...and the Hiigarans claimed the mantle of wisdom left by the ancients.

> In this time of peace and rebuilding, the Hiigarans embraced the gifts of the Progenitors.
Guided by Sajuuk, new doors of understanding opened to them.

> However, as those with no Kiith gained power on Hiigara, the ancient clans turned their ambitions outward.

> In spite of the pleas by Karan S’jet, each Kiith set out from Hiigara to forge their own destinies.

> Each Kiith and Clan began to construct their own fleets once again. Though the Hiigaran people were unified by destiny,
new ambitions began seeking different paths. All of the kiith were going their own way.

> All of them were chasing the lost dream of the Progenitors.

#### MISSION: STAR TOTEK

###### LOCATION:


TANOCHETLAN system, Tanoch territory


###### FACTIONS INVOLVED:


Progenitor, Vaygr



`st_startotek_debri_1_dialog`

**Joanna**
> We must navigate the debris. Although Totek is a colder star, direct exposure to the corona will damage our ships. The debris will shield us.

**Joanna**
> The heat is intense enough to rapidly destroy our strike craft, which lack the armor to survive the corona's intensity.

**Joanna**
> Recommend docking our strike craft and harvesters until we are in a safer area.



`st_startotek_vaygr_1_dialog`

**Joanna**
> We're closing on the location of the Vaygr signal.



`st_startotek_intro_4_dialog`

**Joanna**
> Fleet Intelligence suggests this is the safest route through the debris to the target area.



`st_startotek_vaygr_2_dialog`

**Vaygr Commander**
> My lord, the Hiigarans are here.

**Jochik Kaan**
> Excellent, and very timely. They did not disappoint.

**Jochik Kaan**
> Hiigarans, I extend you a formal welcome to the Nimbus Galaxy.

**Jochik Kaan**
> Of course, I cannot let you interrupt my plans. Since I know it is already useless to ask for your surrender, instead, I'll bid you to die well.

**Jochik Kaan**
> Destroy them.



`st_startotek_intro_3_dialog`

**Joanna**
> Comms are still detecting significant Vaygr signal traffic in the area. They seem to be emanating from here.

**Joanna**
> We need to discover what the Vaygr are doing here, and get a better estimation of their forces.

**Joanna**
> The presence of a Progenitor debris ring is unusual, but we can use this to get closer to the signal point. Use the debris to shield our ships from the heat of the star.



`st_startotek_intro_2_dialog`

**Joanna**
> Totek is highly unusual. Outside temperatures are only a fraction of what we would expect for a star of this size.

**Joanna**
> Though the star has central religious significance to the Tanoch, very little scientific data is publicly known about it.



`st_startotek_senti_1_dialog`

**Joanna**
> Attack drones detected. Be careful maneuvering here, don't let the drones draw you out into the sun.



`st_startotek_vaygr_1_dialog`

**Joanna**
> We're closing on the location of the Vaygr signal.



`st_startotek_senti_2_dialog`

**Joanna**
> If we go to the signal point from here, we'll be catching them by complete surprise. Do you wish to cross here?



`st_startotek_senti_4_dialog`

**Joanna**
> More attack drones. Keep the fleet together Commander, don't let them draw us into the sunlight!



`st_startotek_battle_2_dialog`

**Joanna**
> Vaygr reinforcements coming out of Hyperspace!



`st_startotek_salva_3_dialog`

**Joanna**
> Based on sensor analysis, this object is a power transmission nodule. It collects energy from the star to beam to distant targets.

**Joanna**
> There are literally thousands of these arrays in orbit around Totek. It seems Jochik was salvaging a component from them... but we don't know what it is.

**Joanna**
> We won't find more answers here. We need to continue investigating local systems and inquire among the Tanoch.



`st_startotek_salva_2_dialog`

**Joanna**
> He's taunting us. This raises even more questions about what the Vaygr intend to do in Nimbus.

**Joanna**
> For now lets focus on surviving the moment!



`st_startotek_salva_1_dialog`

**Vaygr Commander**
> The nodule is loaded and secured, my lord.

**Jochik Kaan**
> Excellent.

**Jochik Kaan**
> We are finished here, Hiigarans. I will depart now.

**Jochik Kaan**
> But I leave you with one bit of advice, and a warning.

**Jochik Kaan**
> Do not rest to your assumptions. All can change in an instant.

**Jochik Kaan**
> And you have much to learn about the extent of the Progenitor's Legacy.

**Jochik Kaan**
> Farewell.



`st_startotek_intro_1_dialog`

**Joanna**
> Hyperspace jump successful.

**Joanna**
> We are in orbit over what the Tanoch call Star Totek: Their Holy star.


### CINEMATIC: VAYGR BETRAYAL
> The Vaygr's betrayal is complete. The Throne World of Tanoch is in flames. Cazoma, Emperor of the Tanoch people, is missing.

> In this desperate hour the remaining leaders of the Tanoch turn to the Hiigarans. Placing their trust in the Hiigarans, they share what they know about the Vaygr.

> The mounting evidence showed the Vaygr were here for a purpose, and they were close to seizing their objective....

> ...an ancient facility, containing what may be one of the only Progenitor super weapons in existence.

> We must stop the Vaygr before they can reach this facility and retreive the Progenitor weapon.

> Hiigara itself may depend on us to stop them.

**Joanna**

`st_bTemple_escap_1_dialog`

**Joanna**
> We should escape and regroup, but the Amassari have activated Hyperspace Inhibitors to pin us. We must destroy them!

### CINEMATIC: KIITHLESS
> I am Vice Admiral Kidara Sasan, commanding Task Force Amalek. Our objective is to locate the gate nexus in this galaxy, secure it for the Hiigaran Empire, and unlock travel between our galaxy and this one.

> I am convinced the ancient Amassari knew of its location. We have been scouring their structures in search of further evidence to point us in the right direction. Our next destination is their ancient capital of Hataldan.

> Vice Admiral, the Progenitor ruins and Amassari structures on them here belong to the Amassari. I can't abide further attacks on their sovereignty with military force.

> Your Kiith have the nerve to claim you respect the sovereignty of those who live here! The Amassari are in the way of the Hiigaran Empire. They will be swept aside, as all others have been, so we can claim our destiny.

> Must the road to Hiigaran ascendancy be paved with the blood of innocents? These are their homes, Vice Admiral!

> Where was this bleeding compassion when six hundred thousand Kushan invaders seized Hiigara? Your hypocrisy disgusts me. We are advancing on Hataldan. It's up to you if you want to follow.

`s_hataldan_dialog_conclusion`

**Amassari**
> Hiigarans, I am Elder Kotlan of the Lyad. Your bravery does not go amiss, but neither does the behavior of your ally. What are your intentions?

**Vashti**
> We were betrayed by one of our own. On our honor as exiles, we will free the Observer and punish its captor.

**Amassari**
> If you do this on behalf of the Makers, your name will be spoken and remembered by all Amassari. Good fortune to you.



`s_hataldan_dialog_fightWon`

**Vashti**
> The keepers are here. Avoid contact until the EMP is ready. First charge energizing now.



`s_hataldan_dialog_empTut`

**Joanna**
> The Observer was the only thing keeping the Keepers from attacking. We can't let them destroy the Amassari!

**Vashti**
> Commander, my ship is equipped with an EMP weapon designed to disrupt the Keepers. We completed it after Wiracoda.

**Vashti**
> We can stun the Keepers for a short time and render them vulnerable. We only have 3 charges, make them count!



`s_hataldan_dialog_abduction3`

**Kidara**
> That's not my problem, Vice Admiral. I'm sure you Kiithid will figure it out. Meanwhile, I have a job to do. Fleet, hyperspace in five!



`s_hataldan_dialog_abduction2`

`s_hataldan_dialog_interlude`

**Vashti**
> This many keepers in one place makes me nervous. Stay alert commander.



`s_hataldan_dialog_approach`

**Joanna**
> The Observer itself is sending us coordinates. I think it's an invitation to approach.



`s_hataldan_dialog_intro3`

**Kidara**
> As if these barbarians are any threat to us. We are here for the Observer, what do we care if we offend them?



`s_hataldan_dialog_intro2`

**Vashti**
> The Observer is here. Tread carefully, the Amassari seem to be arranged in some sort of ritual.



`s_hataldan_dialog_intro1`

**Joanna**
> Hyperspace jump complete. This is Hataldan, capital of the ancient Hagthar Empire, the ancestors of the Amassari.



`s_hataldan_dialog_failKharKalaad`

`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_failKharKalaad`

**Joanna**
> Commander, the Khar-Kaalad has been hit! We must withdraw!



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_station`

**Kidara**
> You may destroy my station, but I will fight to the last!



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_freeObserver`

**Observer**
> The Observer awakens. Now we shall end this conflict, together.



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_engage`

**Vashti**
> Kidara doesn't seem to be here, but I wouldn't rule out an ambush. Begin the attack!



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnD`

**Kidara**
> Lies and cowardice. The secrets of the Progenitors are ours. If you will not join me, then die and be forgotten as you should have been on Kharak!



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnC`

**Joanna**
> Kidara, please see reason! This path to power is the path to ruin! It destroyed the ancient Hiigarans! It destroyed the Hagthar!



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnB`

**Vashti**
> Your recklessness will kill us all! You can't just brute force your way to enlightenment, Kidara! The works of the Progenitors still contain many dangers!



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnA`

**Kidara**
> I knew you arrogant Kiithid couldn't resist one last attempt to stop our plans. It will not matter. I will crush the Amassari and bring glory to Hiigara.



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnE`

**Vashti**
> It's either Kidara's way or ours. We must stop her!



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_end`

**Amassari**
> What you have done today is worthy of tales and legends, you have returned the Observer to us. Our thanks to you is without end.

**Joanna**
> We had to make our transgression right. But we have to ask, what is Ya' Axtche? What did the Observer mean?

**Amassari**
> It is an ancient word, one of our oldest, from before the days of our ancestors. Ya' Axtche is the World Tree, the beating heart of the universe.



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_observerC`

**Observer**
> All paths converge at Ya' Axtche. Begin your quest at the Five Watchers. All other paths you find will fail.



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_observerB`

**Observer**
> The road of the ancients is fractured. All paths to Archara are blocked by ancient order. Only one road remains that will lead you home.



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_observerA`

**Observer**
> Children of Hiigara. Continuity resumes. What was unbalanced is now steadied. The path resumes its shape.



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_win`

**Joanna**
> Even to the end, Kidara couldn't allow others to win. The zeal of these Kiithless is disturbing.

**Vashti**
> She could have been so much more if she just set aside her pride for the sake of others. Now she's gone, along with all who followed her.

**Joanna**
> What matters is that the Observer is freed. The Amassari are coming in. They're celebrating.



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_destruct`

**Kidara**
> I curse you with my last breath, Kiithid! You'll die here with me. You will never see our Homeworld again!



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_emp`

**Joanna**
> Commander, torpedoes incoming. Don't let them hit us!



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_introC`

**Joanna**
> The Observer is here. It is being chained by EMP-beams of custom design. We must destroy these platforms to set the Observer free.



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_introB`

**Vashti**
> The Kiithless have built a stronghold in the nebula. There are heavy defenses. This must be Kidara's main base.



`s_nightmareGulf_dialog_introA`

**Joanna**
> Hyperspace jump complete. The Nightmare Gulf is still disrupting sensors. We would never have found this place without the Hagthar.

## Chapter: 34. The Promised Place


### Quest: Gesture of Aid


###### DESCRIPTION:


We received emergency communication from the Chicuat Elders. They anticipate a raid on one of their remote trading stations. Toci asks us to take on the defense in order to relieve the weakened and overextended Chicuat forces.

`e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_intro`

**Joanna**
> Hyperspace jump completed. There's no sign of the raiders yet, we should take defensive positions.

**Toci Citalicue**
> We're fortunate to make it in time. Today my people will be protected and we may learn more about our attackers as well.



`e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_firstWave`

**Joanna**
> There they are. Hostile units are on approach vectors. Prepare for contact!



`e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_nextWave`

**Joanna**
> Commander, another wave is approaching!



`e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_stationLow`

**Toci Citalicue**
> Commander, our station can't withstand much more of this. My people are dying, do something!



`e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_win`

**Joanna**
> The raid has failed, we've held the line. Salvage teams are already scanning the debris for anything of interest from the attacking ships.

**Toci Citalicue**
> Commander, these vessels belong to the Tecuban. But why would they carry out raids against us? They've never been this desperate.

**Joanna**
> What are the Tecuban? Are they a people like the Chicuat, subjects of the Empire?

**Toci Citalicue**
> Yes. Like us, they are a people who live within the Empire. But they have never been openly hostile to us or any other. Perhaps they are taking advantage of the recent chaos?

**Joanna**
> Commander, we can't repel these raids forever. Like it or not, we'll need to get more involved in this internal dispute within the Empire.



`e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_fail`

**Joanna**
> Commander, the station just disintegrated. We've failed... we must withdraw.


### Quest: In the Shadows


###### DESCRIPTION:


Intelligence from the Chicuat points to a Tecuban base operating around an uninhabited planet. We must go there and eliminate this base to stop the raids.

Tanoch Tecuban, Vaygr



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_intro`

**Joanna**
> We've found the base. It's active with many hostiles in the area. We're outnumbered, but if we engage carefully we can maximize the element of surprise.

**Toci Citalicue**
> This base is larger than I expected, which is troubling. Wipe it from this system to send a message. These raids will no longer be tolerated!



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_alert`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we're being illuminated by active targeting. Hostile craft approaching.



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_wave`

**Joanna**
> More enemy craft emerging from hyperspace.



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_boss`

**Joanna**
> More enemies... strange... are that Vaygr craft? What are they doing here?



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_vaygr`

**Vaygr Commander**
> Hiigarans! Eliminate them immediately, there must be no witnesses!



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_win`

**Joanna**
> All threats neutralized. There was no sign of Heyoka, but the Vaygr appearing here raises a lot of questions.

**Toci Citalicue**
> Who are these Vaygr? I have heard of the name, but nothing more.

**Joanna**
> The Vaygr are enemies of ours from a war almost two decades ago. Somehow they're here in Nimbus too.

**Toci Citalicue**
> So the Tecuban have allied with these Vaygr to pillage my people? This... this is worse than I imagined.

**Joanna**
> You have powerful allies now as well. If the Vaygr are involved, this is our fight too. Together we'll get to the bottom of this.


### Quest: Attack the Vaygr


###### DESCRIPTION:


In our search for the Vaygr involved with the Tecuban, we aquired one of their communication frequencies. If we contact the Vaygr now, we should be able to trace their signal and hyper jump to their exact location.

###### FACTIONS INVOLVED:


Vaygr



`e_tanWin2023_Relic_intro`

**Joanna**
> Commander, the Vaygr are ahead. They appear to be patrolling a Progenitor artifact.

**Toci Citalicue**
> Why are these Vaygr interested in objects from the Makers?

**Joanna**
> To fulfill an ancient prophecy, originally. Like us the Vaygr understand how to use these ancient devices.



`e_tanWin2023_Relic_contact`

**Vaygr Commander**
> Hiigarans! You are meddling in affairs that are not of your business. May death be your reward!



`e_tanWin2023_Relic_wave`

**Joanna**
> More Vaygr are emerging from hyperspace, Commander.



`e_tanWin2023_Relic_boss`

**Vaygr Commander**
> You are far from home, Hiigarans! You will die here forgotten!



`e_tanWin2023_Relic_boss_low`

**Vaygr Commander**
> Curse you, Hiigarans! You will never spoil the plans of Jochik Kaan, heir to the rightful Saju-ka!



`e_tanWin2023_Relic_win`

**Joanna**
> All hostiles defeated. So Jochik Kaan is pulling the strings in this conflict. He must have some deeper plan here for the Vaygr to be this involved.

**Toci Citalicue**
> Yet another ruthless leader behind the attacks upon my people? It is not enough for the Tecuban to turn against us?

**Joanna**
> We must discover what Jochik Kaan is trying to achieve here. Once we do, we'll put a stop to it.


### Quest: Showdown at the Academy


###### DESCRIPTION:


We finally learned Jochik Kaan's intentions. He sparked the flames of war to weaken the Chicuat defenses and steal the Baetyl from Tlapallan Academy, one of their key centers of learning. We must travel there at once, before it is too late.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Complete mission 'Tlapallan Academy T4'

**Tepin Papan**
> Commander, I've come to assist you! Our people shall not fail today!



`e_tanWin2023_Academy_jochikDownB`

**Jochik Kaan**
> Savor your insignificant victory today, Hiigarans! I will crush you the next time we meet. Consider that a promise.



`e_tanWin2023_Academy_win`

**Toci Citalicue**
> The Tlapallan Academy is safe. My people are protected and our enemies are on the run... I can't believe we prevailed.

**Tepin Papan**
> The Tecuban have retreated. It seems Heyoka tried to get to the relic before Jochik did, and paid the price.

**Toci Citalicue**
> His greed brought him to pillage the future of my people for his own gratification. I don't mourn his death.

**Tepin Papan**
> Our people are safe for now, but the Chicuat need a voice to speak on their behalf among our allies. Toci, you could be that voice among the Hiigarans.

**Joanna**
> We would be grateful to have you aboard, Toci. Your people are always welcome among us.



`e_tanWin2023_Academy_failTepin`

**Joanna**
> Tepin Papan's vessel was destroyed. We can't stop Jochik. All ships, retreat immediately!

`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_arrival`

**Chocoan Coatl**
> More pilgrim ships have arrived to see the conjuction. Bless the Makers.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_conjunctionA`

**Chocoan Coatl**
> The Conjunction is the clearest sign that our Makers were powerful and wise. The messages they left in the alignment of the stars are profound, even if their exact meaning is lost.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_conjunctionB`

**Chocoan Coatl**
> Though there are signs and portents of a great change coming, there is hope also in this change. Yes there is uncertainty, but the signs point to a great relief.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_deviation`

**Joanna**
> Chocoan what's going on? You're deviating from the path! We must protect the perimeter.

`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_change`

**Joanna**
> More hostile incoming. Chocoan, what the hell is going on? We need your help or civilians will die!

**Chocoan Coatl**

`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_end`

**Joanna**
> Chocoan, what was going on back there?

**Chocoan Coatl**
> I can only confess. Our Elders pervert these pilgrimages with their own causes and ambitions. We rake the ruins of the Makers, scoop them into our hulls, for some reason.

**Joanna**
> They're looking for some Progenitor technology in those asteroids, aren't they?

**Chocoan Coatl**
> It would seem to be so. The Elders will surely take retribution for my failure, so I am without a place for I surely cannot return. I am no longer Envoy, or shephard, of my people.

**Joanna**
> You are always welcome among us, Chocoan. The warmth you showed your people could be a great asset to us as an envoy to the Yaot in the future.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_fail`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we have Pilgrim ships going down. Critical mission failure. Abort immediately.
