		**Joanna**
		Wiracoda Gate. I never imagined we'd return so soon. We were so optimistic when we first arrived here...

		**Gideon S'jet**
		Time is of the essence. The Freighter containing the Negotiator must be a specific distance to the gate in order to activate. Move quickly, Commander!

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_go_

		**Joanna**
		Commander, the Progenitors are relenting... they're becoming passive to our presence.

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_MalikComment_
		**Joanna**
		What in Sajuuk's name is going on?

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_MalikA_
		**Keeper Malik**
		The Keeper has awakened.

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_cateRetreating_
		**Catequil**

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_standGround_

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_progIncoming_
		**Joanna**
		Progenitor defenses are reacting to our presence. Hold them off, don't yield this time!

		**Gideon S'jet**
		Defend the Negotiator at all cost. We cannot lose it. It's our only chance to return home.

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_regeneration_
		**Gideon S'jet**
		Commander, the Keeper has just self-repaired! This ability is nothing I've seen before.

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_control_
		**Gideon S'jet**
		The Negotiator is working. A little longer and we will regain control of the gate... and our route home.

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_MalikC_
		**Keeper Malik**
		The Keeper will destroy!

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_deviceKilled_
		**Joanna**
		Commander, the Progenitor Negotiator was destroyed. We failed the special operation. We must retreat immediately!

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_deviceLost_
		**Gideon S'jet**
		No... what have you done, fools! The Negotiator... you've ruined everything!

		_e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_escape_
		**Joanna**
		Commander, we cannot win this fight. As long as this Keeper regenerates itself, we don't stand a chance. I'm afraid we must flee the gate once again.

### Personal Log, Enoch S’jet
Date: 10.8.9641

I struggle to find the words to define this moment. This should be a cause for celebration, a triumph of exploration, and a furthering of Hiigaran knowledge as we push back the boundary of the unknown. No great discovery is made without plenty of failure, but those great words sound differently now, as an Admiral in command of thousands about to embark into the unknown.

I look at this roster of vessels under my command and find myself thinking of the men and women I will now be responsible for, our mission, and the failure rate of these expeditions. Under the direction of the Daiamid and the vision from Karan S’jet herself, we press on to uncover more secrets of the Progenitors. But it’s hard to imagine how our expedition will truly succeed where so many others vanish without a trace, especially ones bound for this universe.

But go we must. There’s too much at stake riding on us not knowing what lay on the other side. We know Makaan sent vessels through this gate and we must learn what became of them. If there’s a threat to Hiigara looming out there, it must be stopped, or at least investigated. We’ve fought for so long and so hard to just ignore this. So, we go.

Though if we fail... none will know of our fate. We’ll be another few thousand sacrificed to this endeavor. What memorial will be erected in our memory? How will be honored by the people who sent us? I already know this new Daiamid is only using us as fodder for their ambitions. There will be no ceremony for us on Hiigara.

So if we are to go, I pray we can survive whatever fate stopped so many and find a future for our people. We have been exiles before, if we must be so again, so be it. I can only wish that someday, some of our number survives the command of the Daiamid and makes it home again to tell of our story.

### Mission [event_halloween2023_Rashidun_t4/Rashidun T4]
**LOCATION:** KRIITANA system, Cangacian territory

		_e_halloween2023_Rashidun_intro_
		**Joanna**
		Hyperspace jump completed. Is this another gate? It's not on any known charts. We're not reading the errant Keeper on sensors.

		**Gideon S'jet**
		These two corrupted derelicts emanate enormous energy. They must be the source of the Keeper's abnormal powers. We have to destroy them!

		_e_halloween2023_Rashidun_malikSee_
		**Keeper Malik**
		The keeper sees the enemy.

		_e_halloween2023_Rashidun_combat_
		**Gideon S'jet**
		Commander, as long as the Keeper is energized, it will have the ability to self-repair. Avoid it for now and focus on destroying the derelicts!

		_e_halloween2023_Rashidun_derelictWave_
		**Joanna**
		Commander, the derelict is spawning a wave of hostile units!

		_e_halloween2023_Rashidun_malikRegenA_
		**Gideon S'jet**
		The keeper is regenerating itself. It is pointless to attack it for now. Focus on the derelicts!

		_e_halloween2023_Rashidun_derelictDownA_
		**Gideon S'jet**
		The first derelict is destroyed. The energy field is weakening, but we must destroy the other one as well!

		_e_halloween2023_Rashidun_malikDestroyA_
		**Keeper Malik**
		The keeper will destroy!

		_e_halloween2023_Rashidun_malikRegenB_

## EVENT: EVENT_TANOCHWINTER_2023_T4

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day01_t4/Day 1: Resource Relief]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	We received priority communication from Lazarus Base. A subfaction of the Tanoch, the Chicuat, have made contact with Hiigaran representatives and requested aid. Fleet Command wants us to support the Chicuat and establish friendly ties. Our first task is to provide basic resources.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: GainItem

### The Chicuat
Originally the Chicuat were secular thinkers and visionaries in the early days of Tanochet’s interstellar travels. They had considered the ruins of the Makers as the tools of mortals, rather than divine engines of creation, and began to question the nature of long-held beliefs. Seen with envy and revolution by the pious Tanoch, it sparked the first interstellar conflict between the people of Tanochet.

State-sponsored propaganda has characterized the Chicuat as an irreverent, heretical, scheming people. They are often cast as the villains in far-ranging conspiracy theories with designs to topple the empire and destroy the Tanoch religion. This is far from the truth, as the Chicuat are merely trying to live in the margins provided, but they make for a convenient enemy the Empire frequently uses to oppress any perceived dissent.

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day02_t4/Day 2: Processor Surrogate]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	The Chicuat infrastructure is badly degraded with age and suffered heavy damage in recent attacks. We're asked to refine materials to support their restoration efforts.

**DESCRIPTION**:
	Ekekko, our Iyatequa liaison, has suggested to negotiate a trade deal with his contacts to support the Chicuat's need for basic supplies. We should sell some of our own items to get the traders interested.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: GainItem

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day05_t4/Day 5: Gesture of Aid]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	We received emergency communication from the Chicuat Elders. They anticipate a raid on one of their remote trading stations. Toci asks us to take on the defense in order to relieve the weakened and overextended Chicuat forces.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: Complete mission 'Repulse Raid T4'

### Mission [event_tanWin2023_DefendBase_t4/Repulse Raid T4]
**LOCATION:** TEOZACOZ system, Tanoch territory

		_e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_intro_
		**Joanna**
		Hyperspace jump completed. There's no sign of the raiders yet, we should take defensive positions.

		**Toci Citalicue**
		We're fortunate to make it in time. Today my people will be protected and we may learn more about our attackers as well.

		_e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_firstWave_
		**Joanna**
		There they are. Hostile units are on approach vectors. Prepare for contact!

		_e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_nextWave_
		**Joanna**
		Commander, another wave is approaching!

		_e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_stationLow_
		**Toci Citalicue**
		Commander, our station can't withstand much more of this. My people are dying, do something!

		_e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_win_
		**Joanna**
		The raid has failed, we've held the line. Salvage teams are already scanning the debris for anything of interest from the attacking ships.

		**Toci Citalicue**
		Commander, these vessels belong to the Tecuban. But why would they carry out raids against us? They've never been this desperate.

		**Joanna**
		What are the Tecuban? Are they a people like the Chicuat, subjects of the Empire?

		**Toci Citalicue**
		Yes. Like us, they are a people who live within the Empire. But they have never been openly hostile to us or any other. Perhaps they are taking advantage of the recent chaos?

		**Joanna**
		Commander, we can't repel these raids forever. Like it or not, we'll need to get more involved in this internal dispute within the Empire.

		_e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_fail_
		**Joanna**
		Commander, the station just disintegrated. We've failed... we must withdraw.

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day06_t4/Day 6: Imperial Appeal]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	We must find out whether the Tecuban really are behind the recent attacks on the Chicuat. Our contact in the Tanoch Empire might be able to provide information. We should do some assignments to show good faith.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: 5 Faction_Tanoch_T4up

### The Tecuban
The Tecuban enter the oral history of the Tanoch as slaves taken from the northern continent in ancient times. A hardy but downtrodden people, the Tecuban have been historically dismissed as dim-witted menials and peasants by the rest of the Tanoch population. This state-sported mischaracterization has kept the Tecuban from attaining much beyond their segregated portions in the Tanoch Empire. Their numbers increased as they took in victims of the Empire’s early conquests, and they now lend their name and culture to an underclass spanning across the Empire.

Recently the Tecuban have welcomed strangers that claim to be from outside the galaxy. For the first time in living memory they have been promised the chance to rise above their station by joining with these outsiders and conquering for themselves.

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day07_t4/Day 7: Black Eye]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	Lazarus Base has processed Tepin Papan's information. There are reports about the rising influence of an ambitous leader named Heyoka. He is promoting expansionist ideas and has a particular disdain for the Chicuat. We should find out if the name is familiar in the criminal underworld here.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: 10 ShipsDestroyedTanochT4

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day08_t4/Day 8: Catch and Kill]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	Our investigations produced evidence for contact between the Tecuban leader Heyoka and high profile criminals. We must hunt down these outlaws to learn more.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: Complete side mission

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day09_t4/Day 9: Raise the Stakes]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	The Chicuat Elders have asked us to wait for their intelligence report on possible Tecuban forces within Acatla. In the meanwhile we should strengthen our forces to prepare for battle.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: Craft

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day10_t4/Day 10: In the Shadows]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	Intelligence from the Chicuat points to a Tecuban base operating around an uninhabited planet. We must go there and eliminate this base to stop the raids.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: Complete mission 'Base Busting T4'

### Mission [event_tanWin2023_AttackBase_t4/Base Busting T4]
**LOCATION:** ACATLA system, Tanoch territory

		_e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_intro_
		**Joanna**
		We've found the base. It's active with many hostiles in the area. We're outnumbered, but if we engage carefully we can maximize the element of surprise.

		**Toci Citalicue**
		This base is larger than I expected, which is troubling. Wipe it from this system to send a message. These raids will no longer be tolerated!

		_e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_alert_
		**Joanna**
		Commander, we're being illuminated by active targeting. Hostile craft approaching.

		_e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_wave_
		**Joanna**
		More enemy craft emerging from hyperspace.

		_e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_boss_
		**Joanna**
		More enemies... strange... are that Vaygr craft? What are they doing here?

		_e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_vaygr_
		**Vaygr Commander**
		Hiigarans! Eliminate them immediately, there must be no witnesses!

		_e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_win_
		**Joanna**
		All threats neutralized. There was no sign of Heyoka, but the Vaygr appearing here raises a lot of questions.

		**Toci Citalicue**
		Who are these Vaygr? I have heard of the name, but nothing more.

		**Joanna**
		The Vaygr are enemies of ours from a war almost two decades ago. Somehow they're here in Nimbus too.

		**Toci Citalicue**
		So the Tecuban have allied with these Vaygr to pillage my people? This... this is worse than I imagined.

		**Joanna**
		You have powerful allies now as well. If the Vaygr are involved, this is our fight too. Together we'll get to the bottom of this.

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day11_t4/Day 11: Imperial Rumors]

	In order to gather information about the Vaygr's activity we must contact Tepin Papan once more. We should do some assignments to compensate him for his assistance.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: 225 RepTanoch

### The Second Homeworld War
This pivotal conflict in Galactic Standard Year 9625 shaped the galaxy with its ramifications. The seeds of the conflict began when the Warlord Makaan located a Progenitor Far-Jump Hyperspace Core- the third one to be found. Knowing that one was in possession of the enigmatic Bentusi and the other were held by the Hiigarans, he embarked on a war to claim all three and declare himself heir to the Progenitor legacy.

With the power of a far-jump hyperspace core to fuel his conquest, Makaan smashed the Taiidan Republic and began an overwhelming assault on the rest of the galactic core. The force of his attack shattered the unity of the Galactic Council, and only the leadership and dedication of the Hiigarans managed to prevent the galaxy from being overrun. In order to stop Makaan, the legendary figure Karan S’jet emerged from seclusion to personally lead the force to defeat him.

Karan embarked on a voyage to discover the whereabouts of Sajuuk, which according to prophecy was where the three Progenitor Cores must be united. Along the way she received the Bentusi’s final gift, the first core, and raced to the center of the galaxy. There she and Makaan engaged in one final duel to the death, with the winner claiming the legacy of the Progenitors. Karan emerged victorious, ushering in the Age of S’jet.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: Complete mission 'Destination T4'

### Mission [event_tanWin2023_Relic_t4/Destination T4]
**LOCATION:** CUILCO system, Tanoch territory

		_e_tanWin2023_Relic_intro_
		**Joanna**
		Commander, the Vaygr are ahead. They appear to be patrolling a Progenitor artifact.

		**Toci Citalicue**
		Why are these Vaygr interested in objects from the Makers?

		**Joanna**
		To fulfill an ancient prophecy, originally. Like us the Vaygr understand how to use these ancient devices.

		_e_tanWin2023_Relic_contact_
		**Vaygr Commander**
		Hiigarans! You are meddling in affairs that are not of your business. May death be your reward!

		_e_tanWin2023_Relic_wave_
		**Joanna**
		More Vaygr are emerging from hyperspace, Commander.

		_e_tanWin2023_Relic_boss_
		**Vaygr Commander**
		You are far from home, Hiigarans! You will die here forgotten!

		_e_tanWin2023_Relic_boss_low_
		**Vaygr Commander**
		Curse you, Hiigarans! You will never spoil the plans of Jochik Kaan, heir to the rightful Saju-ka!

		_e_tanWin2023_Relic_win_
		**Joanna**
		All hostiles defeated. So Jochik Kaan is pulling the strings in this conflict. He must have some deeper plan here for the Vaygr to be this involved.

		**Toci Citalicue**
		Yet another ruthless leader behind the attacks upon my people? It is not enough for the Tecuban to turn against us?

		**Joanna**
		We must discover what Jochik Kaan is trying to achieve here. Once we do, we'll put a stop to it.

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day17_t4/Day 17: Polite Inquiries]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	There is still no answer from Tepin Papan since we last spoke with him. We should do some more assignments to gain his attention and see if he was able to gather any information about the Vaygr's intentions.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: 5 Faction_Tanoch_T4up

### Jochik Kaan
Disturbingly little is known about Jochik Kaan, the boy who claims to be the son of Makaan and heir to his rightful destiny. Up until now it was not known whether Makaan had any family.

Ostensibly Makaan’s second son with an unknown concubine, Jochik and the rest of Makaan’s Crusade were sent to the Nimbus Galaxy by Makaan for safekeeping while he fought against the Hiigarans. Evidently Jochik managed to climb his way to leadership of the Crusade and hatch a long-term plan in Nimbus. His confidence and haughtiness when facing the Hiigarans can only suggest he has a plan and is confident about its execution.

Hiigaran Intelligence has been unable to discern the purpose of his plan, as not even his own lieutenants seem to know, but it appears Jochik has a keen interest in specific Progenitor components. He is observed seeking specific parts or components, possibly to restore a Progenitor ruin, but what that ruin is and to what end is unknown. The only other detail of note is how personally connected he is to the ruler of the Tanoch Empire. By all accounts, the two appear to be close friends, and Jochik is given free run of the Imperial palace.

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day18_t4/Day 18: Purchased Whispers]

	Ekekko wants us to trade on the local markets and see if we find someone who's willing to sell information on Jochik Kaan's motives.

	We contacted the Chicuat Elders and told them about Jochik Kaan's possible intention to obtain a particular Progenitor object. They have given us intel about a criminal organization that deals with Progenitor objects within the Tanoch Empire. We should investigate.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: Complete side mission

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day20_t4/Day 20: Providing Protection]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	While Gideon S'jet is researching the data set of Progenitor objects, the Chicuat Elders have informed us of a resurgance of Tecuban activity within their territory. We should support the defensive efforts.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: 10 ShipsDestroyedTanochT4

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day21_t4/Day 21: Hunt for Knowledge]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	Gideon S'jet's research into the data set of Progenitor objects turned out more difficult than expected. He asked us to support him to accelerate the process.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: GainItem

### Quest [qe_tanWin_2023_day22_t4/Day 22: Showdown at the Academy]
**DESCRIPTION**:
	We finally learned Jochik Kaan's intentions. He sparked the flames of war to weaken the Chicuat defenses and steal the Baetyl from Tlapallan Academy, one of their key centers of learning. We must travel there at once, before it is too late.

**GOALS**:
	* Task 1: Complete mission 'Tlapallan Academy T4'

### Mission [event_tanWin2023_Academy_t4/Tlapallan Academy T4]
**LOCATION:** TOCHTEOP system, Tanoch territory

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_intro_
		**Joanna**
		Commander, the Vaygr are already in-system. Are we too late?

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_heyoka_
		**Jochik Kaan**
		You've obstructed my plans for the last time, Heyoka! I have no use for disobedient fools!

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_situation_
		**Toci Citalicue**
		The Vaygr are attacking the Tecuban? What is happening?

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_hiigarans_
		**Vaygr Commander**
		My lord, the Hiigarans have arrived. They are approaching for battle.

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_combat_
		**Jochik Kaan**
		All my enemies have gathered... no matter. We will crush them all and take what we came for.

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_jochikDownA_
		**Jochik Kaan**
		Reposition the flagship. Deploy the reserves. Destroy the Hiigarans!

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_JochikReturn_
		**Joanna**
		Jochik has returned. All forces, engage his ship immediately!

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_academyLow_
		**Toci Citalicue**
		The Academy is under attack! Commander, do something!

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_tepin_
		**Tepin Papan**
		Commander, I've come to assist you! Our people shall not fail today!

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_jochikDownB_
		**Jochik Kaan**
		Savor your insignificant victory today, Hiigarans! I will crush you the next time we meet. Consider that a promise.

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_win_
		**Toci Citalicue**
		The Tlapallan Academy is safe. My people are protected and our enemies are on the run... I can't believe we prevailed.

		**Tepin Papan**
		The Tecuban have retreated. It seems Heyoka tried to get to the relic before Jochik did, and paid the price.

		**Toci Citalicue**
		His greed brought him to pillage the future of my people for his own gratification. I don't mourn his death.

		**Tepin Papan**
		Our people are safe for now, but the Chicuat need a voice to speak on their behalf among our allies. Toci, you could be that voice among the Hiigarans.

		**Joanna**
		We would be grateful to have you aboard, Toci. Your people are always welcome among us.

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_failTepin_
		**Joanna**
		Tepin Papan's vessel was destroyed. We can't stop Jochik. All ships, retreat immediately!

		_e_tanWin2023_Academy_failAcademy_
		**Joanna**
		The Academy has fallen... we can't stop Jochik. All ships, retreat immediately!

### Toci's Letter
Commander,

I cannot clearly express with words in your language how much your assistance means to me and my people. The Chicuat have always been persecuted, harassed, and scapegoated through Tanoch history. For the first time in living memory, we have allies, and we have a chance of stopping the abuse at last. We begin small but there is hope now where there was none before.

Of course there is no news across the Empire of our victory, no word of the Vaygr, or the artifacts they tried to steal. Inconvenient things like the truth often disappear in the Empire while it is dominated by this ruthless theocracy. We all know the real power behind the throne, and it concerns me more why the Temple forces are not responding to Vaygr influence. The Empire may not be oblivious to our struggle after all.

In the end, all that matters is that my people are now safe and standing. Thanks to you we now have the means to provide for ourselves and find a way forward to our own greatness and self determination someday.

From myself and all the Chicuat people, we thank you.

Toci Citalicue

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_intro_
		**Chocoan Coatl**
		Blessings, Hiigarans The People are relieved that you are here. The pilgrimage will begin moving to the conjunction point.

		**Joanna**
		Greetings. We are ready to assist the convoy. All ships on full alert, keep your eye out for incoming pirates.

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_interlude_
		**Chocoan Coatl**
		Behold the splendor of the Maker's works. We are blessed that they have lasted this long after the cataclysm. Truly a timeless wonder.

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_arrival_
		**Chocoan Coatl**
		More pilgrim ships have arrived to see the conjuction. Bless the Makers.

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_conjunctionA_
		**Chocoan Coatl**
		The Conjunction is the clearest sign that our Makers were powerful and wise. The messages they left in the alignment of the stars are profound, even if their exact meaning is lost.

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_conjunctionB_
		**Chocoan Coatl**
		Though there are signs and portents of a great change coming, there is hope also in this change. Yes there is uncertainty, but the signs point to a great relief.

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_deviation_
		**Joanna**
		Chocoan what's going on? You're deviating from the path! We must protect the perimeter.

		**Chocoan Coatl**
		It must be done. Our ways are... not to be questioned by outsiders. Please, maintain defensive positions.

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_attackA_
		**Joanna**
		Hostiles incoming. Protect the pilgrims. Intercept the attackers!

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_attackB_
		**Joanna**

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_end_
		**Joanna**
		Chocoan, what was going on back there?

		**Chocoan Coatl**
		I can only confess. Our Elders pervert these pilgrimages with their own causes and ambitions. We rake the ruins of the Makers, scoop them into our hulls, for some reason.

		**Joanna**
		They're looking for some Progenitor technology in those asteroids, aren't they?

		**Chocoan Coatl**
		It would seem to be so. The Elders will surely take retribution for my failure, so I am without a place for I surely cannot return. I am no longer Envoy, or shephard, of my people.

		**Joanna**
		You are always welcome among us, Chocoan. The warmth you showed your people could be a great asset to us as an envoy to the Yaot in the future.

		_e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_fail_

		Commander, we have Pilgrim ships going down. Critical mission failure. Abort immediately.
