#### Mail: Captain’s Log, Mahel Manaan

```
Day 547
When I was a boy, my father would tell me stories of the Trader’s Bargain. Long gone now, I can picture that lone standing stone at the edge of the Shiiaro Mountains. The Manaan remember it as a promise of the joy to come. Now, I think of how solitary it was standing above the sands alone.

```
Day 577
It is said the Kaalel have no true friends, but every one is a true friend to the Manaan. I can’t think of a better way to describe my time among these Iyatequa: The lone Manaan against these secret-keepers. But the old Manaan adage is still true: the slight of hand is more powerful than anything any coin could ever buy. Now is a war between magicians.

**Hiigaran Commander**

**Hiigaran Commander**

`e_iyaFall2023_escort_dialog_fail`

**Joanna**

###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_iyaFal_2023_day15_t4_end`

## Event: event_anniversary_2023_t4


### Quest: Day 1: Research Directive


**DESCRIPTION:**

We received priority communication from Hiigaran Command of Lazarus Base concerning Gideon S'jet. We need to decrypt it in our laboratory first before we can read it.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day01_A_t4_end`

**Gideon S'jet**

**Joanna**
> The transmission has a priority directive attached to it, making these our official new orders. Let us begin immediately.





### Quest: Day 1: Seek and Find


**DESCRIPTION:**

The list given to us by Gideon includes many components found only in Progenitor ships. The easiest way to collect them is to harvest them from downed Progenitor units.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 7 ShipsDestroyedProgenitorT4



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day01_B_t4_end`

**Gideon S'jet**
> Excellent. We have harvested many required items from destroyed wreckages. Now I need you to find an intact Progenitor Cognition Node.

**Joanna**
> Commander, Gideon's secrecy can only mean he's working on something important. I wonder where his research will lead us.





### Quest: Day 1: The Capstone


**DESCRIPTION:**

Progenitor Cognition Nodes are a fragile component often found floating in free space near ancient wreckages.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day01_C_t4_end`

**Gideon S'jet**
> Thank you, Commander. I will start my research on the Progenitor Cognition Node. I need you to acquire more components in the meantime. I left a list with your adjutant.

**Joanna**
> Commander, reading the list Gideon left us, I do not recognize any of these items. Maybe Ekekko, our liaison with the Iyatequa, can help us find them.





### Quest: Day 2: Cash Money


**DESCRIPTION:**

Ekekko can bring us in contact with traders specialized in Progenitor technology. But knowing the Iyatequa, everything has a price. We should mine minerals to recuperate the losses we'll have to pay.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day02_A_t4_end`

**Ekekko**
> Splendid, my friend. Splendid! These resources should be sufficient to make the right inquiries about ancient objects. I'll put out feelers, as they say.

**Joanna**
> I have an uneasy feeling about Ekekko's contacts. I hope we can make the right impression.





### Quest: Day 2: Songs and Tales


**DESCRIPTION:**

To impress the Iyatequa traders and procure the Progenitor components for Gideon, we will have to work on our reputation among a certain clientele.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 225 RepTr1



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day02_B_t4_end`

**Ekekko**
> You're in luck, friend! I managed to find a seller for some of the parts you are seeking. With a little luck and a hefty amount of credits, I can arrange to acquire them for you.

**Joanna**
> Thank you Ekekko. I'm sure we can find something in our cargo hold to exchange for credits.





### Quest: Day 2: Merchant Supreme


**DESCRIPTION:**

In order to raise funds to acquire the needed Progenitor components for Gideon, we must sell some of our stored items on the local market.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day02_C_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Excellent news, Commander! We managed to acquire much of Gideon's list in the transaction. Only a few parts remain.

**Ekekko**
> I was able to haggle additional information. One of the parts you're seeking has cultural significance to the Yaot. A fleet under the command of Zaque Guahai is looking for it now. Good luck!





### Quest: Day 3: Stop Scouting


**DESCRIPTION:**

We need to search for recent communications data in this sector to pick up a lead on Guahai's Yaot fleet. We should find what we are looking for on recently destroyed ships.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 15 ShipsDestroyedT4



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day03_A_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander! We recovered Yaot communication from the transmission logs of one of the downed ships.

**Guahai**
> ...and continue scouring the region! Finding the Stambha has utmost priority. You will locate that reconnaissance disk, or there will be...

**Joanna**
> Interesting. Reconnaissance disks are usually part of a ship's integral data box. If we collect salvage from hostiles in the area, we might be able to find this item first.





### Quest: Day 3: Sifting for Gold


**DESCRIPTION:**

We are in search of the missing data disk Guahai mentioned in his transmission. We might be able to find it in salvage crates from local outlaws.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day03_B_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> We're in luck, we've recovered the reconnaissance disk Guahai is seeking. Navigation has the location of this Stambha. Hopefully it's the part Gideon is looking for...





### Quest: Day 3: Concluding Battle


**DESCRIPTION:**

The reconnaissance disk gave us a lead on the Progenitor component the Yaot call the Stambha. Enemy activity is high in the target location.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Complete side mission



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day03_C_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> We have found the artifact and transferred it to the laboratory. Commander, the Yaot must know we have it, incoming transmission from Guahai.

**Guahai**
> Your blaspheme against the Makers will not be forgotten, Hiigarans! The Stambha is not supposed to be in your hands! Your transgression will be remembered.

**Joanna**
> It seems odd that the Yaot attach so much significance to a deep-space antenna. But then, our own people believed Sajuuk was a deity before finding the ship bearing the name.





### Quest: Day 4: Lost and Found


**DESCRIPTION:**

Gideon has emerged from his laboratory. He talks of the possibility to build a device that could change the fortunes of Hiigarans in Nimbus. However, we must search for a final component.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Scan



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day04_A_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> We have scanned the sector successfully, but discovered nothing of significance. Gideon, what are we looking for?

**Gideon S'jet**
> Commander, in order to use the antenna we must find a specific piece of Progenitor equipment to match it as a receiver. An adapter also must be build to connect them.





### Quest: Day 4: Raw Materials


**DESCRIPTION:**

Gideon is in need of raw materials to construct a secret device. We should look for a jovian planet to collect some gas.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day04_B_t4_end`

**Gideon S'jet**
> Resources received and processed. We should focus our efforts on finding the receiver component, but I have come up with no leads yet.

**Ekekko**
> Well and met, friend. I have heard vague rumors that an object of the given description is in possession of a powerful outlaw. I suggest stirring up the local underworld.





### Quest: Day 4: Patrol Conclusion


**DESCRIPTION:**

According to Ekekko, the last component on Gideon's list might be in the hands of a powerful enemy. The search for additional information is sending us into the most dangerous areas of this sector.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Complete side mission



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day04_C_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, many criminals have heard stories about the object in question. It is rumored to be stolen in a legendary heist from a Tanoch temple.

**Ekekko**
> The Tanoch? I'm afraid I don't have many contacts with the Empire. But didn't you make friends with one of their commanders?





### Quest: Day 5: Help Wanted


**DESCRIPTION:**

We want to make contact with Tepin Papan, commander of the Tanoch Empire. To find a communication channel, we should do some hired work for the local authorities.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 5 Faction_T4up



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day05_A_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we have succeeded in opening a communication channel to Tepin Papan. Sending a request for assistance now.

**Tepin Papan**
> Greeting, Commander. It has been too long. The information you seek is rather difficult to obtain, but for a few favors, I might be able to take the risk on your behalf.





### Quest: Day 5: See the Universe


**DESCRIPTION:**

Tepin Papan has offered to provide information on Gideon's last component if we help him with a security issue he currently faces.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Complete 3 side missions



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day05_B_t4_end`

###### LOCATION:


LAZARUS system, Hiigaran Medea territory



`e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_intro`

**Joanna**
> Wiracoda Gate. I never imagined we'd return so soon. We were so optimistic when we first arrived here...

**Gideon S'jet**
> Time is of the essence. The Freighter containing the Negotiator must be a specific distance to the gate in order to activate. Move quickly, Commander!



`e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_go`

**Joanna**
> Admiral Enoch perished here ordering us to return home. We would honor his wishes by completing his final command.



`e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_cateIncoming`

`e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_standGround`

**Gideon S'jet**
> The cowards are fleeing. We must stand our ground. We might be able to retrieve the Negotiator's parts!



`e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_MalikB`

**Keeper Malik**
> The Keeper sees the enemy.



`e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_progIncoming`

**Joanna**
> Progenitor defenses are reacting to our presence. Hold them off, don't yield this time!

**Gideon S'jet**
> Defend the Negotiator at all cost. We cannot lose it. It's our only chance to return home.



`e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_regeneration`

`e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_escape`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we cannot win this fight. As long as this Keeper regenerates itself, we don't stand a chance. I'm afraid we must flee the gate once again.


###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_anniversary_2023_day10_A_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander… we came across this at the gate. It’s a log transmission from Admiral Enoch. I’ve sent it to your private mail to review on your own.





#### Mail: Personal Log, Enoch S’jet

```
Date: 10.8.9641

I struggle to find the words to define this moment. This should be a cause for celebration, a triumph of exploration, and a furthering of Hiigaran knowledge as we push back the boundary of the unknown. No great discovery is made without plenty of failure, but those great words sound differently now, as an Admiral in command of thousands about to embark into the unknown.

I look at this roster of vessels under my command and find myself thinking of the men and women I will now be responsible for, our mission, and the failure rate of these expeditions. Under the direction of the Daiamid and the vision from Karan S’jet herself, we press on to uncover more secrets of the Progenitors. But it’s hard to imagine how our expedition will truly succeed where so many others vanish without a trace, especially ones bound for this universe.

But go we must. There’s too much at stake riding on us not knowing what lay on the other side. We know Makaan sent vessels through this gate and we must learn what became of them. If there’s a threat to Hiigara looming out there, it must be stopped, or at least investigated. We’ve fought for so long and so hard to just ignore this. So, we go.

Though if we fail... none will know of our fate. We’ll be another few thousand sacrificed to this endeavor. What memorial will be erected in our memory? How will be honored by the people who sent us? I already know this new Daiamid is only using us as fodder for their ambitions. There will be no ceremony for us on Hiigara.

So if we are to go, I pray we can survive whatever fate stopped so many and find a future for our people. We have been exiles before, if we must be so again, so be it. I can only wish that someday, some of our number survives the command of the Daiamid and makes it home again to tell of our story.
```



## Event: event_halloween_2023_t4


### Quest: Day 1: Sentinel Duty

###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 10 ShipsDestroyedProgenitorT4



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_halloween_2023_day01_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> This Progenitor behavior is unlike anything we’ve seen before. They’re actively attacking now, they’ve only been passive before.

**Gideon S'jet**
> Everything started with the corrupted Keeper at the gate. The last time Progenitor devices behaved like this was many thousands of years ago... at the close of the Progenitor Empire. History must not repeat!





### Quest: Day 2: Prospector


**DESCRIPTION:**

Gas refineries are being targeted by the Progenitors in many sectors of Nimbus. Stocks need to be replenished if the defenders are to hold off this calamity.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_halloween_2023_day02_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> We have delivered the raw material to the refineries in need, Commander. The defenses are strong for now, but they won't hold off the Progenitor attacks forever.

**Gideon S'jet**
> We triggered this incursion... It is our responsibility to find a way to stop it. We should collect data and begin research immediately





### Quest: Day 3: Deep Space Recovery


**DESCRIPTION:**

Gideon wants to collect any evidence which points to the Progenitor’s current activity. We should collect data from ships that were in combat with the abnormal Progenitor vessels.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_halloween_2023_day03_t4_end`

**Gideon S'jet**
> Commander, what we have gathered indicates the active Progenitors being controlled by a malignant frequency. It must come from the corrupted Keeper.

**Joanna**
> So we can put an end to the attacks by taking out the errant Keeper? But at the gate we couldn't even harm it...





### Quest: Day 4: Smelt and Refine


**DESCRIPTION:**

Many planets are still in desperate need of resources to hold off the Progenitors. Especially rare resources have been in high demand to increase defensive capabilities.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_halloween_2023_day04_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> We delivered the rare material to support the defense forces. Most garrisons are still holding strong, but the continual assaults are starting to weaken many sectors.

**Gideon S'jet**

###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_halloween_2023_day05_t4_end`

**Gideon S'jet**
> I analyzed the command frequency. I don't understand... It's absurdly powerful. I suspect another Progenitor technology must be channeling energy to the Keeper.

**Joanna**
> Something else is energizing the corrupted Keeper? Perhaps destroying this source will neutralize its strange regenerative powers.





### Quest: Day 6: Replacement Parts


**DESCRIPTION:**

Many sectors have suffered heavy damages from the ongoing Progenitor attacks. More parts are needed to replenish the defending fleets.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Craft



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_halloween_2023_day06_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> We provided the parts to replenish the defense forces. Their resolve is still strong, but at this rate of attrition, many systems won't be able to hold out much longer.

**Gideon S'jet**
> Commander, I fully decrypt the malignant command frequency. If we collect components from receiving Progenitor vessels I can start to triangulate the errant Keeper's location.





### Quest: Day 7: Triangulation


**DESCRIPTION:**

In order for Gideon to triangulate the location of the errant Keeper we need to hunt down Progenitor vessels receiving its command signal.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 10 ShipsDestroyedProgenitorT4



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_halloween_2023_day07_t4_end`

**Gideon S'jet**

**Joanna**
> Commander, as this mission is of the utmost importance, I advise you to perform one last fleet wide ready-check.





### Quest: Day 9: Military Exercise


**DESCRIPTION:**

In order to be fully prepared for the confrontation with the corrupted Keeper, we need to perform a fleet wide ready-check for all systems. We can engage enemies that have been preying on the local area lately due to the diminished security situation.


###### GOALS:

###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_halloween_2023_day09_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, all systems are ready for our critical mission. Gideon has provided us with the exact location of the Keeper's signal. We are ready.

**Ekekko**
> Greetings, friend. It came to my attention that you need to negotiate a non-aggression agreement with the Cangacians. I'll see what my contacts can do.





### Quest: Day 10: Safe Passage


**DESCRIPTION:**

The Iyatequa promised to negotiate a deal for safe passage into Cangacian space. However, even though the galaxy is at stake, the traders still insist on receiving a hefty price.

`e_halloween2023_Rashidun_malikSee`

**Keeper Malik**
> The keeper sees the enemy.



`e_halloween2023_Rashidun_combat`

**Gideon S'jet**
> Commander, as long as the Keeper is energized, it will have the ability to self-repair. Avoid it for now and focus on destroying the derelicts!



`e_halloween2023_Rashidun_derelictWave`

**Joanna**
> Commander, the derelict is spawning a wave of hostile units!



`e_halloween2023_Rashidun_malikRegenA`

**Joanna**
> Excellent work, Commander. You put a stop to the Progenitor incursion. You saved the galaxy.

**Gideon S'jet**
> We ended what we began by accident, but the door back home remains closed. We cannot give up on this quest. There will come another day.




## Event: event_tanochwinter_2023_t4


### Quest: Day 1: Resource Relief


**DESCRIPTION:**

We received priority communication from Lazarus Base. A subfaction of the Tanoch, the Chicuat, have made contact with Hiigaran representatives and requested aid. Fleet Command wants us to support the Chicuat and establish friendly ties. Our first task is to provide basic resources.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day01_t4_end`

**Toci Citalicue**
> Greetings, Commander. I am Toci Citalicue, and I will act as liaison between you and my people, the Chicuat. I cannot thank you enough for your aid in this troubled time.

**Joanna**
> It is our pleasure to help wherever we can. Lazarus offers assistance to all friendly factions still recovering from the recent Progenitor assaults.





#### Mail: The Chicuat

```
Originally the Chicuat were secular thinkers and visionaries in the early days of Tanochet’s interstellar travels. They had considered the ruins of the Makers as the tools of mortals, rather than divine engines of creation, and began to question the nature of long-held beliefs. Seen with envy and revolution by the pious Tanoch, it sparked the first interstellar conflict between the people of Tanochet.

State-sponsored propaganda has characterized the Chicuat as an irreverent, heretical, scheming people. They are often cast as the villains in far-ranging conspiracy theories with designs to topple the empire and destroy the Tanoch religion. This is far from the truth, as the Chicuat are merely trying to live in the margins provided, but they make for a convenient enemy the Empire frequently uses to oppress any perceived dissent.
```

### Quest: Day 2: Processor Surrogate


**DESCRIPTION:**

The Chicuat infrastructure is badly degraded with age and suffered heavy damage in recent attacks. We're asked to refine materials to support their restoration efforts.


###### GOALS:

**Toci Citalicue**
> We’ve been able to restore critical machinery which will help us stabilize our industry. Thank you, it wouldn’t be possible without your assistance.

**Joanna**
> Commander, I'm wondering why the Empire isn't helping the Chicuat. It seems the Tanoch have abandoned these people to their fate.





### Quest: Day 3: Wayward Cargo


**DESCRIPTION:**

The Chicuat have informed us several critical supply convoys have gone missing. We should try to retrieve any goods by hunting down local bandits.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day03_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we found cargo belonging to the Chicuat. Foodstuffs, basic machinery, textiles… not the valuable loot you'd expect.

**Toci Citalicue**
> My people have suffered many raids on basic infrastructure lately. Whoever is behind these attacks is trying to destabilize us even further. This madness is inhumane!





### Quest: Day 4: Relief Package


**DESCRIPTION:**

Ekekko, our Iyatequa liaison, has suggested to negotiate a trade deal with his contacts to support the Chicuat's need for basic supplies. We should sell some of our own items to get the traders interested.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day04_t4_end`

**Ekekko**

`e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_win`

**Joanna**
> The raid has failed, we've held the line. Salvage teams are already scanning the debris for anything of interest from the attacking ships.

**Toci Citalicue**
> Commander, these vessels belong to the Tecuban. But why would they carry out raids against us? They've never been this desperate.

**Joanna**
> What are the Tecuban? Are they a people like the Chicuat, subjects of the Empire?

**Toci Citalicue**
> Yes. Like us, they are a people who live within the Empire. But they have never been openly hostile to us or any other. Perhaps they are taking advantage of the recent chaos?

**Joanna**
> Commander, we can't repel these raids forever. Like it or not, we'll need to get more involved in this internal dispute within the Empire.



`e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_fail`

**Joanna**
> Commander, the station just disintegrated. We've failed... we must withdraw.


### Quest: Day 6: Imperial Appeal


**DESCRIPTION:**

We must find out whether the Tecuban really are behind the recent attacks on the Chicuat. Our contact in the Tanoch Empire might be able to provide information. We should do some assignments to show good faith.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 5 Faction_Tanoch_T4up



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day06_t4_end`

**Tepin Papan**
> Greetings Commander. I'm pleased to hear you've been assisting my kinsmen, the Chicuat. I'm surprised you suspect the Tecuban behind these attacks, but I'm sending what information I have.

**Toci Citalicue**
> I'm surprised you know Tepin Papan. Though many Tanoch hold my people with destain, every Chicuat is proud to serve in the Empire. I'm relieved to know we have his assistance.

**Joanna**
> We met Tepin Papan in the Empty Quarter shortly after we arrived in Nimbus. Lazarus Base will process his information on the Tecuban.





#### Mail: The Tecuban

```
The Tecuban enter the oral history of the Tanoch as slaves taken from the northern continent in ancient times. A hardy but downtrodden people, the Tecuban have been historically dismissed as dim-witted menials and peasants by the rest of the Tanoch population. This state-sported mischaracterization has kept the Tecuban from attaining much beyond their segregated portions in the Tanoch Empire. Their numbers increased as they took in victims of the Empire’s early conquests, and they now lend their name and culture to an underclass spanning across the Empire.

Recently the Tecuban have welcomed strangers that claim to be from outside the galaxy. For the first time in living memory they have been promised the chance to rise above their station by joining with these outsiders and conquering for themselves.
```

### Quest: Day 7: Black Eye


**DESCRIPTION:**

Lazarus Base has processed Tepin Papan's information. There are reports about the rising influence of an ambitous leader named Heyoka. He is promoting expansionist ideas and has a particular disdain for the Chicuat. We should find out if the name is familiar in the criminal underworld here.

###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day07_t4_end`

**Toci Citalicue**
> Commander, we found communications data among the wreckages that contains Heyoka's name. He must be involved with the local criminal network.

**Joanna**
> I'm astounded the Tecuban would fall in with criminals. They may be destitute as we are, but even they would not normally raise a fist against other Tanoch.





### Quest: Day 8: Catch and Kill


**DESCRIPTION:**

Our investigations produced evidence for contact between the Tecuban leader Heyoka and high profile criminals. We must hunt down these outlaws to learn more.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Complete side mission



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day08_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we retrieved more communications data between the criminals and Heyoka. We were able to trace his last location to a system called Acatla.

**Toci Citalicue**
> Acatla? How can this be? That is well within Chicuat borders. Commander, I implore you, please investigate immediately!





### Quest: Day 9: Raise the Stakes


**DESCRIPTION:**

The Chicuat Elders have asked us to wait for their intelligence report on possible Tecuban forces within Acatla. In the meanwhile we should strengthen our forces to prepare for battle.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Craft



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day09_t4_end`

**Toci Citalicue**
> Hiigaran combat power is impressive, Commander. The Chicuat have always suffered persecution within the Empire. It feels very good to have a powerful ally for once.

**Joanna**
> We understand the desperation. Only a century ago, we were just six hundred thousand exiles fighting an interstellar empire to retake our lost homeworld. We stand by your side in this conflict.





### Quest: Day 10: In the Shadows


**DESCRIPTION:**

Intelligence from the Chicuat points to a Tecuban base operating around an uninhabited planet. We must go there and eliminate this base to stop the raids.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Complete mission 'Base Busting T4'



#### Mission: Base Busting T4

###### DESCRIPTION:


-



###### LOCATION:


ACATLA system, Tanoch territory


###### FACTIONS INVOLVED:


Tanoch Tecuban, Vaygr



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_intro`

**Joanna**
> We've found the base. It's active with many hostiles in the area. We're outnumbered, but if we engage carefully we can maximize the element of surprise.

**Toci Citalicue**
> This base is larger than I expected, which is troubling. Wipe it from this system to send a message. These raids will no longer be tolerated!



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_alert`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we're being illuminated by active targeting. Hostile craft approaching.



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_wave`

**Joanna**

`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_boss`

**Joanna**
> More enemies... strange... are that Vaygr craft? What are they doing here?



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_vaygr`

**Vaygr Commander**
> Hiigarans! Eliminate them immediately, there must be no witnesses!



`e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_win`

**Joanna**
> All threats neutralized. There was no sign of Heyoka, but the Vaygr appearing here raises a lot of questions.

**Toci Citalicue**
> Who are these Vaygr? I have heard of the name, but nothing more.

**Joanna**
> The Vaygr are enemies of ours from a war almost two decades ago. Somehow they're here in Nimbus too.

**Toci Citalicue**
> So the Tecuban have allied with these Vaygr to pillage my people? This... this is worse than I imagined.

**Joanna**
> You have powerful allies now as well. If the Vaygr are involved, this is our fight too. Together we'll get to the bottom of this.


### Quest: Day 11: Imperial Rumors


**DESCRIPTION:**

In order to gather information about the Vaygr's activity we must contact Tepin Papan once more. We should do some assignments to compensate him for his assistance.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 225 RepTanoch



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day11_t4_end`

**Tepin Papan**
> It has been rumored the Vaygr are sheltering in Tecuban space. I will learn what I can, but these Vaygr have the patrongae of the Emperor. It will be difficult.

**Toci Citalicue**
> The Vaygr are friends of the Emperor? Perhaps this is why the Empire is turning a deaf ear to our current plight. We may be hated, but never has the Empire ignored us as they have in this time.





#### Mail: The Second Homeworld War

```
This pivotal conflict in Galactic Standard Year 9625 shaped the galaxy with its ramifications. The seeds of the conflict began when the Warlord Makaan located a Progenitor Far-Jump Hyperspace Core- the third one to be found. Knowing that one was in possession of the enigmatic Bentusi and the other were held by the Hiigarans, he embarked on a war to claim all three and declare himself heir to the Progenitor legacy.

With the power of a far-jump hyperspace core to fuel his conquest, Makaan smashed the Taiidan Republic and began an overwhelming assault on the rest of the galactic core. The force of his attack shattered the unity of the Galactic Council, and only the leadership and dedication of the Hiigarans managed to prevent the galaxy from being overrun. In order to stop Makaan, the legendary figure Karan S’jet emerged from seclusion to personally lead the force to defeat him.

Karan embarked on a voyage to discover the whereabouts of Sajuuk, which according to prophecy was where the three Progenitor Cores must be united. Along the way she received the Bentusi’s final gift, the first core, and raced to the center of the galaxy. There she and Makaan engaged in one final duel to the death, with the winner claiming the legacy of the Progenitors. Karan emerged victorious, ushering in the Age of S’jet.
```

### Quest: Day 12: Seek and Recover


**DESCRIPTION:**

While Tepin Papan is trying to gather information about the Vaygr's involvement with the Tecuban, we should scan some systems and see if we can find any clues about their whereabouts.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Scan



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day12_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we are not finding any hard evidence of the Vaygr's activity around these systems. We're only picking up whispered rumors among the locals.

**Toci Citalicue**
> The people have been through a lot lately. They're scared and uncertain. We'll need to gain their trust if we want to get someone to talk.





### Quest: Day 13: Among the People


**DESCRIPTION:**

We hope to learn more about the Vaygr's activity from the local people. We should do some good deeds around here to gain their trust.


###### GOALS:

###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day13_t4_end`

**Toci Citalicue**
> Commander, our plan to gain the trust of the local people has worked. Our best lead comes from a nearby outpost.

**Joanna**
> That is great news. They claim to have information that could match our description of the Vaygr. But they want us to help them with something before they hand it over.





### Quest: Day 14: Active Search


**DESCRIPTION:**

Some local folks have agreed to provide information that could lead to the Vaygr. However, before they hand it over, they want us help them with a particularly challenging mission.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Complete side mission



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day14_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we received the information from the locals. It seems someone overheard a frigate crew boasting about working for powerful outsiders. This could be the Vaygr!

**Toci Citalicue**
> I'm glad we could do something for the local people. Let's hunt down the Vaygr now and find out what they are scheming with the Tecuban!





### Quest: Day 15: Hunting Party


**DESCRIPTION:**

We must hunt down a group of thugs that is suspected to be working for the Vaygr.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 10 ShipsDestroyedTanochT4



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day15_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, onboard one of these vessels we found communications data with a Vaygr frequency. This is the lead we've been waiting for.

**Toci Citalicue**
> It's disturbing how many here are drawn to Vaygr promises of power, though I am not surprised. The Tecuban have even less than we do, and have more to gain from such an alliance.





### Quest: Day 16: Attack the Vaygr


**DESCRIPTION:**

In our search for the Vaygr involved with the Tecuban, we aquired one of their communication frequencies. If we contact the Vaygr now, we should be able to trace their signal and hyper jump to their exact location.


###### GOALS:

`e_tanWin2023_Relic_intro`

**Joanna**
> Commander, the Vaygr are ahead. They appear to be patrolling a Progenitor artifact.

**Toci Citalicue**

**Joanna**
> To fulfill an ancient prophecy, originally. Like us the Vaygr understand how to use these ancient devices.



`e_tanWin2023_Relic_contact`

**Vaygr Commander**
> Hiigarans! You are meddling in affairs that are not of your business. May death be your reward!

> You are far from home, Hiigarans! You will die here forgotten!



`e_tanWin2023_Relic_boss_low`

**Vaygr Commander**
> Curse you, Hiigarans! You will never spoil the plans of Jochik Kaan, heir to the rightful Saju-ka!



`e_tanWin2023_Relic_win`

**Joanna**
> All hostiles defeated. So Jochik Kaan is pulling the strings in this conflict. He must have some deeper plan here for the Vaygr to be this involved.

**Toci Citalicue**
> Yet another ruthless leader behind the attacks upon my people? It is not enough for the Tecuban to turn against us?

**Joanna**
> We must discover what Jochik Kaan is trying to achieve here. Once we do, we'll put a stop to it.


### Quest: Day 17: Polite Inquiries


**DESCRIPTION:**

There is still no answer from Tepin Papan since we last spoke with him. We should do some more assignments to gain his attention and see if he was able to gather any information about the Vaygr's intentions.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 5 Faction_Tanoch_T4up



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_tanWin_2023_day17_t4_end`

**Tepin Papan**
> Commander, I've expended every avenue to gather more information. To probe further would risk my position, and I cannot help my people if I'm dismissed from my post. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

**Toci Citalicue**
> Even our allies in the Empire can no longer help us. What does Jochik have to gain through brutalizing my people? What does he want?

**Ekekko**
> My friends, if the answer can't be aquired through proper channels we should turn to the local markets. Let the power of coin open the door between you and the answer you seek.





#### Mail: Jochik Kaan

```
Disturbingly little is known about Jochik Kaan, the boy who claims to be the son of Makaan and heir to his rightful destiny. Up until now it was not known whether Makaan had any family.

Ostensibly Makaan’s second son with an unknown concubine, Jochik and the rest of Makaan’s Crusade were sent to the Nimbus Galaxy by Makaan for safekeeping while he fought against the Hiigarans. Evidently Jochik managed to climb his way to leadership of the Crusade and hatch a long-term plan in Nimbus. His confidence and haughtiness when facing the Hiigarans can only suggest he has a plan and is confident about its execution.

Hiigaran Intelligence has been unable to discern the purpose of his plan, as not even his own lieutenants seem to know, but it appears Jochik has a keen interest in specific Progenitor components. He is observed seeking specific parts or components, possibly to restore a Progenitor ruin, but what that ruin is and to what end is unknown. The only other detail of note is how personally connected he is to the ruler of the Tanoch Empire. By all accounts, the two appear to be close friends, and Jochik is given free run of the Imperial palace.

### Quest: Day 18: Purchased Whispers


**DESCRIPTION:**

Ekekko wants us to trade on the local markets and see if we find someone who's willing to sell information on Jochik Kaan's motives.

**Toci Citalicue**
> My people have hidden many objects of the Makers we retain for study and safekeeping. Jochik delivers pain, suffering, and ruin to my people all to attain an object of the Makers? Monster!





### Quest: Day 19: Getting There First


**DESCRIPTION:**

We contacted the Chicuat Elders and told them about Jochik Kaan's possible intention to obtain a particular Progenitor object. They have given us intel about a criminal organization that deals with Progenitor objects within the Tanoch Empire. We should investigate.


###### GOALS:

### Quest: Day 21: Hunt for Knowledge


**DESCRIPTION:**

Gideon S'jet's research into the data set of Progenitor objects turned out more difficult than expected. He asked us to support him to accelerate the process.


###### GOALS:

**Toci Citalicue**
> Curse the Vaygr! They're after the Baetyl? It's placed at the Tlapallan Academy. It's one of our most populated learning centers! We must inform the Elders immediately!





### Quest: Day 22: Showdown at the Academy


**DESCRIPTION:**

We finally learned Jochik Kaan's intentions. He sparked the flames of war to weaken the Chicuat defenses and steal the Baetyl from Tlapallan Academy, one of their key centers of learning. We must travel there at once, before it is too late.

**Tepin Papan**

**Joanna**
> The Academy has fallen... we can't stop Jochik. All ships, retreat immediately!


#### Mail: Toci's Letter

```
Commander,

I cannot clearly express with words in your language how much your assistance means to me and my people. The Chicuat have always been persecuted, harassed, and scapegoated through Tanoch history. For the first time in living memory, we have allies, and we have a chance of stopping the abuse at last. We begin small but there is hope now where there was none before.

Of course there is no news across the Empire of our victory, no word of the Vaygr, or the artifacts they tried to steal. Inconvenient things like the truth often disappear in the Empire while it is dominated by this ruthless theocracy. We all know the real power behind the throne, and it concerns me more why the Temple forces are not responding to Vaygr influence. The Empire may not be oblivious to our struggle after all.

In the end, all that matters is that my people are now safe and standing. Thanks to you we now have the means to provide for ourselves and find a way forward to our own greatness and self determination someday.

From myself and all the Chicuat people, we thank you.

Toci Citalicue
```

**Joanna**
> Yaot pilgrims in the Empty Quarter? Commander, this might be of interest to Hiigaran security. We should find out more about what's going on.





### Quest: Day 2: Buying Information


**DESCRIPTION:**

The Iyatequa traders are involved with pirates attacking Yaot pilgrims in the Empty Quarter. We might get more information through selling equipment and arms on the open market.


###### GOALS:

###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_yaoSpr_2024_day02_t4_end`

**Ekekko**
> Greetings, friend! My fellow tradesmen, of course, say nothing to me about their plans. But plenty of Cangacian marauders were eager to boast of their exploits.

**Joanna**
> Commander, the pirates believe there is valuable treasure on the Yaot pilgrim ships. But for now they were only able to capture basic civilian goods.





### Quest: Day 3: Remote Observation


**DESCRIPTION:**

To learn more about the pirate raids, we should get in contact with the Yaot pilgrims. They appear to be hiding after recent attacks. We have no other option than to perform reconnaissance in the nearby systems.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Scan



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_yaoSpr_2024_day03_t4_end`

In our search for the Yaot pilgrims we have encountered intense pirate activity. We should hunt down some of their ships and see if we can gather any additional clues.


###### GOALS:

**Crew Member**
> Commander, some of the containers we've recovered have casualties. Many were deceased, but we also recovered survivors in critical condition.

**Joanna**

### Quest: Day 5: Lost Pilgrims


**DESCRIPTION:**

Some Yaot survivors in our medical ward are ready to be questioned. If we manage to prove our good intentions they might help us find the Yaot pilgrimage.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_yaoSpr_2024_day05_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we talked to the Yaot survivors. They were indeed part of the pilgrimage. They gave us their normal comm frequency, so we can contact the formation leader directly.

**Chocoan Coatl**
> A warm blessing to you, Hiigarans. I am Chocoan Coatl, Envoy of the Yaot Federation and Shepard of this Conjunction. I thank you for saving the lives of my fellow pilgrims.

**Joanna**
> Greetings Envoy Coatl. We greet you on behalf of the Hiigaran colonies in this area. Your pilgrimage has caused an uprising of pirate activity here. Our authorities are worried about the security situation.

**Chocoan Coatl**
> We are but simple Pilgrims Commander, bound by our faith to visit conjunctions seen in our sky. Until now we had no need for escort, for none took an interest in our mission. This seems to have changed without reason.

**Joanna**
> Commander, we can't leave these civilians defenseless against the pirates. It's unethical to stand by and allow it, we must help them.





### Quest: Day 6: Parts List


**DESCRIPTION:**

The Yaot have accepted our offer to support their pilgrimage. Requests have come in from ships needing spares and replacement parts for repairs. If we provide these, we might learn more about why the pirates are after these ships.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Craft



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:

**Chocoan Coatl**
> Blessings, Hiigarans. You have my thanks for these parts for our vessels. I am seeing to their distribution now.

**Crew Member**
> Commander, as requested we have tracked the delivery of the provided parts. It seems like some ships are clearly being prioritized over others.

**Joanna**
> Interesting. Could these be the treasure ships the pirates were talking about? We need to find out more.





### Quest: Day 7: Clearing the Way


**DESCRIPTION:**

Even though pirates are still swarming the area, Chocoan and the Yaot pilgrims are adamant about continuing their travels to see the astral conjunction events. In order to deter any further attacks on the civilian ships, we should patrol and clear the systems of any significant hostile forces.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Complete side mission



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_yaoSpr_2024_day07_t4_end`

**Crew Member**
> Commander, we have a direct communication from the Cangacian pirates.

**Catequil**
> You continue to meddle in affairs that are none of your business! I will have my treasure, and you will stop foiling my plans!

**Joanna**
> Treasure? What treasure could be aboard these civilian ships? Have you no conscience terrorizing the innocent?

**Catequil**
> Innocent? You Hiigarans are so naive with your trust it's offensive. If you stand in my way again, I will crush you along with these charlatans you defend!





### Quest: Day 8: Knowledge Attained


**DESCRIPTION:**

Even the Fleet of Rams are after the Yaot pilgrim's supposed treasure. If we hope to protect them, we must first convince somebody to give us more information. We should try to make friends with the pilgrims and get somebody to talk.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_yaoSpr_2024_day08_t4_end`

**Chocoan Coatl**
> You gift us with your compassion, commander. Most would not go out of their way to defend a stranger.

**Joanna**
> We Hiigarans were once nearly defenseless refugees ourselves. But what is this pilgrimage, what drives you?

**Chocoan Coatl**
> Our people have made these voyages for centuries. Our history tells us great events coincide with the conjunctions, which must be witnessed. Some of them tell us of the presence of the Makers among us still.

**Joanna**
> This is fascinating... but I don't understand why your group would be targeted. Do you carry something special when observing the conjunction? An artifact of some kind?

**Chocoan Coatl**
> I'm afraid details such as these... must remain unspoken for now. I have much work to do, coordinating with the Elders. We will speak again.





### Quest: Day 9: Polite Inquires


**DESCRIPTION:**

After talking to Chocoan we suspect there is more to the Yaot pilgrimage than the religious travels to astral conjunction events. We might be able to get more information from the Yaot Federation if we do some favors.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: 5 Faction_Yaot_T4up

> That seemed unusually terse. We might need to think outside the box and find our other contacts for further information.





### Quest: Day 10: Gift for Gab


**DESCRIPTION:**

We’ve reached a dead end on collecting intelligence on the Yaot, but our source within the Tanoch Empire has offered to provide more information. We should bring an adequate gift for compensation.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Pay 1 None



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_yaoSpr_2024_day10_t4_end`

**Tepin Papan**
> Hello Commander! Thank you for the artifact, this will buy the information you seek. You're looking for more information on these conjunction pilgrimages?

**Joanna**
> Yes. We're protecting the civilian pilgrims on their travels. Many believe some sort of treasure among their ships. We suspect some kind of involvement from the Yaot Elders.

**Tepin Papan**
> Interesting. Our intelligence concurs with your assessment. We have also suspected the Yaot have some other purpose behind these pilgrimages, something that has direct oversight from their council of Elders.

**Joanna**
> Could this be some secret agenda by their leadership? Are they searching for something? Searching for treasures?

**Tepin Papan**
> The only other thing I can tell you is that our scouts detected ruins of the Makers there previously. What they do with them, we don't know. Good hunting!





### Quest: Day 11: Advanced Scouting


**DESCRIPTION:**

While we still don't know what kind of treasure the pilgrims could have aboard their vessels, Chocoan wants to move on to another astral conjunction event. He has requested our assistance in clearing out the area from any hostile threats.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: Complete side mission



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_yaoSpr_2024_day11_t4_end`

**Crew Member**
> Commander, we've picked up a classified investigation report on the Yaot pilgrimage from one of the hostile vessels. Decryption process initiated.

**Joanna**
> Most interesting. This is a detailed report on the procedure of the pilgrim's convoy at astral conjunction events. I want this evaluated as quickly as possible!





### Quest: Day 12: Unearthing Secrets


**DESCRIPTION:**

The report on the pilgrim's procedure has been fully analyzed. Usually the pilgrim's convoy moves in a tight line formation towards the optimal conjunction points where they perform their religious rituals. However, a few ships regularly diverge from the common path and move into nearby asteroid fields. We should investigate the latest conjunction site and see if we can find anything of interest.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: GainItem



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_yaoSpr_2024_day12_t4_end`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we've collected ore from the asteroids near the astral conjunction site. The material is transferred into the laboratory to be examined.

**Gideon S'jet**
> Commander, I have been monitoring the situation and I will assist in the examination. If there is anything here involving the Progenitors, I will find it.





### Quest: Day 13: The Precession


**DESCRIPTION:**

Chocoan has informed us that the next astral conjunction site will be inside the Cangacian territories. We convinced him to take part in the operation ourselves to ensure security in this hostile area of the Empty Quarter. Maybe we will be able to both protect the pilgrims and find out more about the suspected secret agenda. We should make sure the crew is properly prepared and ready for any eventualities.


###### GOALS:


	* Task 1: UpgradeOfficer



###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_yaoSpr_2024_day13_t4_end`

**Chocoan Coatl**
> Blessings upon you, Commander. My people wish to convey their deepest thanks for your assistance. We are ready to engage the conjunction event in Ze Tavaan. May the Makers be with us.

**Joanna**
> Envoy Coatl, this is Cangacian territory. It is almost certain the Cancagians will be waiting there in ambush. Is this event really so important to your people's faith that it's worth risking their lives?

**Chocoan Coatl**
> The decision... is not mine to make. We are guided by the wisdom of the Elders. But should you wish to provide escort, the people would be relieved to know we are under your protection.





### Quest: Day 14: The Promised Place


**DESCRIPTION:**

Chocoan has provided the coordinates to the next astral conjunction event. Strong hostile forces are to be expected in this system. Our goal is to both protect the civilian pilgrims and find out more about the suspected secret agenda of the Yaot Elders.

> Greetings. We are ready to assist the convoy. All ships on full alert, keep your eye out for incoming pirates.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_interlude`

**Chocoan Coatl**
> Behold the splendor of the Maker's works. We are blessed that they have lasted this long after the cataclysm. Truly a timeless wonder.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_arrival`

**Chocoan Coatl**
> More pilgrim ships have arrived to see the conjuction. Bless the Makers.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_conjunctionA`

**Chocoan Coatl**
> The Conjunction is the clearest sign that our Makers were powerful and wise. The messages they left in the alignment of the stars are profound, even if their exact meaning is lost.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_conjunctionB`

**Chocoan Coatl**
> Though there are signs and portents of a great change coming, there is hope also in this change. Yes there is uncertainty, but the signs point to a great relief.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_deviation`

**Joanna**
> Chocoan what's going on? You're deviating from the path! We must protect the perimeter.

**Chocoan Coatl**
> It must be done. Our ways are... not to be questioned by outsiders. Please, maintain defensive positions.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_attackA`

**Joanna**
> Hostiles incoming. Protect the pilgrims. Intercept the attackers!



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_attackB`

**Joanna**
> More attacks incoming. Chocoan, we need your help here!

**Chocoan Coatl**
> I... please... I can't.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_catequil`

**Catequil**
> So we meet again, Hiigarans. You won't stop me this time. I'll have that treasure, even if I have to rip it out of every ship I see! Do not let any of them escape!



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_change`

**Joanna**
> More hostile incoming. Chocoan, what the hell is going on? We need your help or civilians will die!

**Chocoan Coatl**

`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_catequilLow`

**Catequil**
> You won't always be so fortunate Hiigarans! A thousand curses upon you and your works!



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_win`

**Joanna**
> Perimeter is clear. The attack is over. The pilgrims are safe.

**Chocoan Coatl**
> Under the grace of the Makers, the pilgrims are safe with minimal casualties. Thank you, Commander.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_end`

**Joanna**
> Chocoan, what was going on back there?

**Chocoan Coatl**
> I can only confess. Our Elders pervert these pilgrimages with their own causes and ambitions. We rake the ruins of the Makers, scoop them into our hulls, for some reason.

**Joanna**
> They're looking for some Progenitor technology in those asteroids, aren't they?

**Chocoan Coatl**
> It would seem to be so. The Elders will surely take retribution for my failure, so I am without a place for I surely cannot return. I am no longer Envoy, or shephard, of my people.

**Joanna**
> You are always welcome among us, Chocoan. The warmth you showed your people could be a great asset to us as an envoy to the Yaot in the future.



`e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_fail`

**Joanna**
> Commander, we have Pilgrim ships going down. Critical mission failure. Abort immediately.

`qe_amaSum_2023_day4_t4_end / dia_amasum_2024_day04_end`

###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_amaSum_2023_day6_t4_end / dia_amasum_2024_day06_end`

**DESCRIPTION:**

Kiithless strikes have been increasing against the Amassari. We need to calibrate our training to match their new battle techniques in order to stop them.


###### GOALS:

> Hiigarans that don't originate from one of the original Kiith are not only iconoclasts, but they employ some radical strategies. It was useful in our war against the Vaygr, but it's coming at a cost now.





### Quest: Day 8: Hand against Foe


**DESCRIPTION:**

Our training was timely. Jothru has handed us some leads on potential Kiithless activity in the region. We must investigate.


###### GOALS:

###### END-OF-DAY DIALOG:



`qe_amaSum_2023_day8_t4_end / dia_amasum_2024_day08_end`

`qe_amaSum_2023_day10_t4_end / dia_amasum_2024_day10_end`

> Intelligence suggests the Kiithless were attempting to piece together a Hagthar navigational computer, and they've deduced they need a final piece.

> They're after Thassin's Needle. Only three have ever been found. To my people, they represent a better future that could be.

> We must protect this at all costs.
