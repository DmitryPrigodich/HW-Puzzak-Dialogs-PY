* st_3_1_dialog_attackover_1: Starship, thank you for your assistance. Damage to the stations was minimal, and the People extend their thanks. You are welcome to dock, you have earned it.
* st_3_1_dialog_finish_1: Approaching station. Initiating docking procedure. Our emperor is already awaiting you.
* st_3_1_dialog_failure_1: Commander, one of the stations has suffered a direct hit! Casualty reports are coming through, it's not looking good.
* st_3_1_dialog_failure_2: The Yaot are retreating. Evidently this was a hit and run operation... but did they achieve their objective?
* st_3_1_dialog_failure_3: Starship, we appreciate your assistance, but our emperor has more urgent matters to attend to now. Your visit will have to wait.
* goaltxt_h_story_c01_tanochet_st_tanochet_gmove: Approach Tanochet main station
* goaltxt_h_story_c01_tanochet_st_tanochet_gtorp1: Intercept deep space torpedo

* story_c02_templetonaati: Temple Tonaati
* desc_story_c02_templetonaati: We have traced the Vaygr to this location. Go there and find out what they are doing in this galaxy.
* story_c02_templetonaati_heroic: Temple Tonaati (Heroic)
* desc_story_c02_templetonaati_heroic: We have traced the Vaygr to this location. Go there and find out what they are doing in this galaxy.
* st_3_2_v2_dialog_start_1: We have arrived at what the Tanoch call Star Totek.
* st_3_2_v2_dialog_start_2: Vaygr signal traffic points to this system. They're up to something here, stay alert.
* st_3_2_v2_movetostation_1: Interesting.. Theres a Progenitor structure here. Function is unknown. Tanoch maps identify this as Temple Tonaati.
* st_3_2_v2_movetostation_2: We should begin our investigation there. However, it seems the temple is heavily patrolled by the Tanoch temple forces. They probably won't admit us.
* st_3_2_v2_movetostation_3: Their defenses are formidable, and we don't want to commit sacrilage by attacking a Holy Site.
* st_3_2_v2_movetostation_3a: Solar activity is significant beyond the station, It's too risky to travel there.
* st_3_2_v2_movetostation_4: However, there are two debris field passages we can use to stay safe through the Solar radiation.
* st_3_2_v2_movetostation_5: One is to the left, the other is to the right.
* st_3_2_v2_movetostation_6: We cannot scan the debris fields from this distance, but it is a good guess there may be Progenitor devices active in this debris. Its still safer than turning the Temple's defenses against us.
* st_3_2_v2_civilstation_reached_1: Many ships are headed to the temple, likely carrying pilgrims to worship the star.
* st_3_2_v2_civilstation_reached_2: We've scanned Temple Tonaati. There are no Vaygr ships or transmissions here.
* st_3_2_v2_explainstar_1: This is interesting... the Temple has a built in field generator, creating a magnetic funnel.
* st_3_2_v2_explainstar_2: Not only can we use it to get close to the star through hyperspace, but it will bring us to a specific destination. We won't know until we use it.
* st_3_2_v2_explainstar_3: The Vaygr aren't here now, but they may have passed through this area recently.
* st_3_2_v2_yaotsuddenly_1: Commander, a large cluster of craft have just emerged from Hyperspace. It's... a Yaot attack force.
* st_3_2_v2_yaotsuddenly_2: Attention, Tanoch Defenders. I am Guahai, Zaque of the Yaot Federation. Surrender yourselves, or be destroyed.
* st_3_2_v2_yaotsuddenly_3: This is a civilian installation! The defenses here are too small to fend off an entire attack force!
* st_3_2_v2_yaotsuddenly_4: Do not doubt that we will do what is necessary in the shadow of your holy place. Surrender! We are the stronger here!
* st_3_2_v2_yaotattack_1: The Yaot fleet is too massive for us to even hope to stop. Even if we were to join forces with the temple defenders.
* st_3_2_v2_temple_killed_1: I... commander, the defenses have been destroyed by unknown means. They must have tremendous firepower at their disposal!
* st_3_2_v2_temple_killed_2: I am Chaquen, a Commander in the Yaot Federation.
* st_3_2_v2_temple_killed_3: Hiigarans, you are known to us. I say to you now: abandon these people. You are not involved in this war. Save yourselves. Leave before it is too late.
* st_3_2_v2_temple_killed_4: Commander, we can't sit by and leave these people to their fate. We must defend the installation.
* st_3_2_v2_boss_1: The Yaot are sending another probing force towards us. Prepare for contact!
* st_3_2_v2_finish_1: It seems the Yaot are pulling away from the area. Odd... a force-size like that, they should have destroyed us easily.
* st_3_2_v2_finish_2: Commander... the field generator is disabled. The funnel is gone. The Tanoch must have destroyed it rather than let the Yaot gain possession of it.
* st_3_2_v2_finish_3: The Yaot must know this also, they've left the area. However, we still have the travel vector and coordinates targeted by the funnel. That should be our next destination.
* st_3_2_v2_missionfail_1: The station is gone... so many lives lost. We must escape before the Yaot finish us off as well!
* goaltxt_h_story_c02_templetonaati_s0302v2_markgoal: Slip by the enemy defenses
* story_c03_startotek: Star Totek
* desc_story_c03_startotek: Something is happening at the most Holy Star of the Tanoch Empire.
* story_c03_startotek_heroic: Star Totek (Heroic)
* desc_story_c03_startotek_heroic: Something is happening at the most Holy Star of the Tanoch Empire.
* st_startotek_intro_1_1: Hyperspace jump successful.
* st_startotek_intro_1_2: We are in orbit over what the Tanoch call Star Totek: Their Holy star.
* st_startotek_intro_2_1: Totek is highly unusual. Outside temperatures are only a fraction of what we would expect for a star of this size.
* st_startotek_intro_2_2: Though the star has central religious significance to the Tanoch, very little scientific data is publicly known about it.
* st_startotek_intro_3_1: Comms are still detecting significant Vaygr signal traffic in the area. They seem to be emanating from here.
* st_startotek_intro_3_2: We need to discover what the Vaygr are doing here, and get a better estimation of their forces.
* st_startotek_intro_3_3: The presence of a Progenitor debris ring is unusual, but we can use this to get closer to the signal point. Use the debris to shield our ships from the heat of the star.
* st_startotek_intro_4_1: Fleet Intelligence suggests this is the safest route through the debris to the target area.
* st_startotek_intro_5_1: There is an area where we can risk damage to flank the Vaygr, if they're there. They won't expect us coming from this vector.
* st_startotek_debri_1_1: We must navigate the debris. Although Totek is a colder star, direct exposure to the corona will damage our ships. The debris will shield us.
* st_startotek_debri_1_2: The heat is intense enough to rapidly destroy our strike craft, which lack the armor to survive the corona's intensity.
* st_startotek_debri_1_3: Recommend docking our strike craft and harvesters until we are in a safer area.
* st_startotek_debri_2_1: Warning! We are no longer shielded from the sun. The fleet is taking damage!
* st_startotek_debri_3_1: Initiating Emergency hyperspace! Commander, we have to clear the range of the sun and repair the fleet before we can continue.
* st_startotek_senti_1_1: Attack drones detected. Be careful maneuvering here, don't let the drones draw you out into the sun.
* st_startotek_senti_2_1: If we go to the signal point from here, we'll be catching them by complete surprise. Do you wish to cross here?
* st_startotek_senti_3_1: If we cross here to the signal point, we'll catch anyone out of position. Shall we cross here?
* st_startotek_senti_4_1: More attack drones. Keep the fleet together Commander, don't let them draw us into the sunlight!
* st_startotek_vaygr_1_1: We're closing on the location of the Vaygr signal.
* st_startotek_vaygr_2_1: My lord, the Hiigarans are here.
* st_startotek_vaygr_2_2: Excellent, and very timely. They did not disappoint.
* st_startotek_vaygr_2_3: Hiigarans, I extend you a formal welcome to the Nimbus Galaxy.
* st_startotek_vaygr_2_4: Of course, I cannot let you interrupt my plans. Since I know it is already useless to ask for your surrender, instead, I'll bid you to die well.
* st_startotek_vaygr_2_5: Destroy them.
* st_startotek_battle_1_1: The Vaygr are attacking. We need to push past them to see what they are planning!
* st_startotek_battle_2_1: Vaygr reinforcements coming out of Hyperspace!
* st_startotek_salva_1_1: The nodule is loaded and secured, my lord.
* st_startotek_salva_1_2: Excellent.
* st_startotek_salva_1_3: We are finished here, Hiigarans. I will depart now.
* st_startotek_salva_1_5: But I leave you with one bit of advice, and a warning.
* st_startotek_salva_1_6: Do not rest to your assumptions. All can change in an instant.
* st_startotek_salva_1_7: And you have much to learn about the extent of the Progenitor's Legacy.
* st_startotek_salva_1_8: Farewell.
* st_startotek_salva_2_1: He's taunting us. This raises even more questions about what the Vaygr intend to do in Nimbus.
* st_startotek_salva_2_1_1: For now lets focus on surviving the moment!
* st_startotek_salva_2_2: Based on sensor analysis, this object is a power transmission nodule. It collects energy from the star to beam to distant targets.
* st_startotek_salva_2_3: There are literally thousands of these arrays in orbit around Totek. It seems Jochik was salvaging a component from them... but we don't know what it is.
* st_startotek_salva_2_4: We won't find more answers here. We need to continue investigating local systems and inquire among the Tanoch.

* story_d01_sijinlighthouse_heroic: Sijin Lighthouse (Heroic)
* desc_story_d01_sijinlighthouse_heroic: We detected a possible signal from the missing Khar-Kalaad.
* st_farshore_intro_jo_1: We've arrived at the location of the Khar-Kalaad's distress signal.
* st_farshore_intro_jo_2: I've marked the Khar-Kalaad's exact position on the Sensor's manager. We should investigate.
* st_farshore_intro_jo_3: We have no response to outgoing signals, so either Vice Admiral Vashti is keeping a low profile, or it's a trap. Proceed with caution.
* st_farshore_ally_jo_1: Sensors confirm, it's the Khar-Kalaad.
* st_farshore_ally_va_1: Greetings Commander, it has been a long time.
* st_farshore_ally_jo_2: Vice Admiral! It's good to see you alive! We lost all contact after the battle at Wiracoda Gate.
* st_farshore_ally_va_2: We were forced to conduct major repairs after that battle. We maintained a low profile afterward, in order to avoid attracting attention.
* st_farshore_ally_va_3: By then you had already gotten the attention of the local powers. While you forged ahead we gathered more information about the Progenitors of this galaxy. This lead us here.
* st_farshore_ally_va_4: We signalled you now because we need your assistance. This is a Progenitor Lighthouse, one that we believe contains map information of the local Progenitor systems.
* st_farshore_ally_va_5: Though we have disabled the defenses, we need your communicator to access the main computer.
* st_farshore_ally_jo_3: We've had dubious luck using it in the past. Are you sure it's wise to try it?
* st_farshore_ally_va_6: It's our best chance to access this data. Consider it an order from a superior officer of Task Force Ararat.
* st_farshore_ally_jo_4: We could use that data, and the Vice Admiral is still technically our commander.
* st_farshore_start_jo_1: In order to establish a connection we'll need to dock a resource controller with the Lighthouse. Target is designated.
* st_farshore_hodor_jo_1: Our salvage team has docked with the Lighthouse. They're connecting with the Khar-Kalaad's team now.
* st_farshore_hodor_va_1: Commander, we have incoming hyperspace signatures at distance.
* st_farshore_hodor_jo_2: We can't seem to catch a break, can we?
* st_farshore_hodor_tan_1: Intruders, this site is holy. Surrender your vessels and prepare to be boarded.
* st_farshore_hodor_jo_3: These are Tanoch Temple guardians. We must have offended some Tanoch religious taboo by coming here.
* st_farshore_hodor_jo_4: Engineering, what's your status?
* st_farshore_hodor_eng_1: Connection is being completed now, command. Cryptography is trying to input signal.
* st_farshore_hodor_jo_5: We don't have much time. Another wave is incoming.
* st_farshore_hodor_eng_2: Commander, Cryptography reports there's no cartographic data here.
* st_farshore_hodor_va_2: Are you certain?
* st_farshore_hodor_eng_3: Yes Vice Admiral. We're continuing to investigate.
* st_farshore_hodor_jo_6: We can't take much more of this.
* st_farshore_hodor_eng_4: Command, this tower is a navigational aid. It's used to cross the nearby unstable nebula to reach the other side.
* st_farshore_hodor_jo_7: A tightrope into the maelstrom?
* st_farshore_eye_va_1: More ships are approaching through hyperspace. We cannot delay, any longer and we won't be able to escape safely.
* st_farshore_eye_eng_1: We're close to gaining navigational data to guide us to the other end of the bridge network. We need more time!
* st_farshore_eye_jo_1: Commander... something... odd is happening right above us!
* st_farshore_eye_va_2: What is that?
* st_farshore_eye_jo_2: There's no corresponding craft of this type in our database on the Progenitors.
* st_farshore_eye_obs_1: (Unable to translate)
* st_farshore_eye_va_3: The light house is projecting a massive quantum tunnel! Reading coordinates...
* st_farshore_esc_jo_1: Our engines aren't powerful enough to pursue the Progenitor object.
* st_farshore_esc_jo_2: We have its destination vector. When we have a powerful enough engine, we can pursue.

* st_iliyin_intro_1: Hyperspace jump completed. Looks like the lighthouse guided us successfully through the maelstrom.
* st_iliyin_intro_2: No sign of any recent activity here. This region of space is uncharted to everyone we've met so far in Nimbus.
* st_iliyin_intro_3: Commander!
* st_iliyin_intro_4: The make and composition of the ruins is unknown.
* st_iliyin_intro_5: This is amazing, no other empire we've encountered has been able to build into the Progenitor Ruins as we have.
* st_iliyin_investigation_1: These people might have information about the Progenitors we haven't collected yet. We must investigate.
* st_iliyin_investigation_2: Salvage team aboard, our science teams are investigating what we found. Results in a moment.
* st_iliyin_investigation_3: Commander, my sensor officer has detected hyperspace signatures emerging at some distance. Be on alert, we're not alone here.
* st_iliyin_the_amassari_1: We have incoming!
* st_iliyin_the_amassari_2: (Amassari language, no translation available).
* st_iliyin_the_amassari_3: Linguistics is trying to work on a translation database now.
* st_iliyin_breakwater_1: Until we can communicate we must stand our ground.
* st_iliyin_breakwater_2: More craft incoming. Their armor is stronger than any ship we've encountered in Nimbus. This will be tough.
* st_iliyin_breakwater_3: More of these crafts have emerged from Hyperspace. We may have angered a local power for them to be sending reinforcements.
* st_iliyin_breakwater_4: Commander, translation is up. We have a workable dictionary to communicate with.
* st_iliyin_breakwater_5: This is Vice Admiral Vashti, of the Hiigaran battlegroup Ararat. We mean you no hostility, please cease your attacks!
* st_iliyin_breakwater_6: Outsiders are forbidden among the trees of our ancestors! Submit, or die!
* st_iliyin_breakwater_7: So much for diplomacy. Let's get out of here!

* st_iliyin_observer_4: My God... what just happened?
* st_iliyin_observer_5: Traveler, we are the family Alut of the Amassari. The Observer has blessed you, attacking you was our error.
* st_iliyin_observer_6: What was that thing? Where was it going?
* st_iliyin_observer_7: The Observer is a herald of change. It comes to us in times of great upheaval, we know nothing more beyond this.
* st_iliyin_observer_8: Where can we learn more about the Observer?

* st_btemple_challenge_3: Aliens! You return to pillage our temples and desecrate our lands! May our gods smite you for your barbarity!
* st_btemple_challenge_4: They've cut the communication link! We are under attack!
* st_btemple_retreat_1: Pull back and regroup. We cannot negotiate under these circumstances.
* st_btemple_escape_1: We should escape and regroup, but the Amassari have activated Hyperspace Inhibitors to pin us. We must destroy them!

* s_hataldan_intro3_1: As if these barbarians are any threat to us. We are here for the Observer, what do we care if we offend them?
* s_hataldan_approach_1: The Observer itself is sending us coordinates. I think it's an invitation to approach.
* s_hataldan_interlude_1: This many keepers in one place makes me nervous. Stay alert commander.
* s_hataldan_observer1_1: Children of Hiigara, you are welcomed. Your quest is known to us.

* s_hataldan_abduction1_1: All units, close in and secure the objective. Target hyperspace coordinates for fallback position Delta, Aurex.
* s_hataldan_abduction2_1: Vice Admiral Kidara, stop this! You're endangering us all!
* s_hataldan_abduction3_1: That's not my problem, Vice Admiral. I'm sure you Kiithid will figure it out. Meanwhile, I have a job to do. Fleet, hyperspace in five!
* s_hataldan_emptut_1: The Observer was the only thing keeping the Keepers from attacking. We can't let them destroy the Amassari!
* s_hataldan_emptut_2: Commander, my ship is equipped with an EMP weapon designed to disrupt the Keepers. We completed it after Wiracoda.
* s_hataldan_emptut_3: We can stun the Keepers for a short time and render them vulnerable. We only have 3 charges, make them count!

* s_hataldan_conclusion_1: Hiigarans, I am Elder Kotlan of the Lyad. Your bravery does not go amiss, but neither does the behavior of your ally. What are your intentions?
* s_hataldan_conclusion_2: We were betrayed by one of our own. On our honor as exiles, we will free the Observer and punish its captor.
* s_hataldan_conclusion_3: If you do this on behalf of the Makers, your name will be spoken and remembered by all Amassari. Good fortune to you.

* e_tanwin2023_defendbase_win_4: Yes. Like us, they are a people who live within the Empire. But they have never been openly hostile to us or any other. Perhaps they are taking advantage of the recent chaos?

* raid003_dialog_hp60_1: Another group of pirates appeared on our flank!
* raid003_dialog_hp40_1: It looks like their flagship just emerged from hyperspace. The enemy commander is identifying himself as... Catequil the devisor. Sounds pretentious.
* raid003_dialog_hp40_2: Who? Hiigarans? I don't have time for this nuisance. Eliminate them!

* raid004_tanplead: Hiigaran craft, this is the Opochtli, out of Xelasii. We are under attack by Yaot forces, they are demanding we surrender our VIP. Please help, we can't repulse them for long!

* raid005_intro_3: How do we pass through this shield?
* raid005_intro_4: Two pillars generate the meteor shield that keeps the asteroids contained. They will need to be disabled so that you can pass, but the barrier repairs itself quickly. Be warned also, the Kakahl Amassari do not take kindly to interlopers. Please hurry!
* raid005_intro_5: If we help them they may be able to give us some assistance in this region. We should split up, one command per each base. We'll have to time our assault to drop both bases at the same time to allow entry.
* raid005_base_1: There it is. The structure is Amassari make, a form of Gravity well Generator used to keep asteroids in place. This was probably a holding area for a large mining operation. We're being contacted.
* raid005_base_2: We do not welcome strangers on our mining grounds! Begone! or be destroyed!
* raid005_base_3: We need to rescue the command ship trapped within the field. If you can drop the barrier to rescue the ship, then we have no cause for conflict.

* raid005_wreckship_3: Their hyperdrives will be repaired momentarily but they need to make it out of the asteroid field to activate them, lets stick around until then.
* raid005_lastbattle: A large group of hostile ships is approaching!
* raid005_bossdead: I think they can take it from here. Well done!
* raid005_gateup: We waited too long, the gate node is back online. I'm not certain if we'll be able to disable it again. We'll need to leave the area, there's nothing more we can do.

* cinematic_001_001: It is fifteen years into the age of S’jet
* cinematic_001_002: Fifteen years since the warlord Makaan met his end at Balcora...
* cinematic_001_003: ...and the Hiigarans claimed the mantle of wisdom left by the ancients.
* cinematic_001_004: In this time of peace and rebuilding, the Hiigarans embraced the gifts of the Progenitors.
Guided by Sajuuk, new doors of understanding opened to them.
* cinematic_001_005: However, as those with no Kiith gained power on Hiigara, the ancient clans turned their ambitions outward.
* cinematic_001_005b: In spite of the pleas by Karan S’jet, each Kiith set out from Hiigara to forge their own destinies.
* cinematic_001_006: Each Kiith and Clan began to construct their own fleets once again. Though the Hiigaran people were unified by destiny,
new ambitions began seeking different paths. All of the kiith were going their own way.
* cinematic_001_007: All of them were chasing the lost dream of the Progenitors.
* cinematic_002_001: Hiigara. Our Home.
* cinematic_002_002: Cast out of their world, the old Kiith clans departed. Some would never return.
* cinematic_002_003: As the Age of S’jet dawned across the universe, the Clans became exiles once again. Among the stars, they sought a new destiny.
* cinematic_002_004: The ancient hyperspace gates beckoned travelers towards new and uncertain worlds.
With desperation and hope, the Kiith cast their ambitions through the gates.
* cinematic_002_005: What lay beyond would change their fortunes forever.
* cinematic_007_001: This is my final order to you, Commander.
* cinematic_007_002: Do not allow our people to die in this place.
* cinematic_007_003: Find a way to return through the gates. Fight your way across the universe, if you must.
* cinematic_007_004: Do not let the story of our clans end here among these unfamiliar stars.
* cinematic_007_005: Bring our people home safely. Return to Hiigara. Farewell.
* cinematic_007_006: There is no sign of the Riif-Sa. Or the Khar-Kaalad.
No Hiigaran signal traffic of any kind is detected.
* cinematic_007_007: We are alone.
* cinematic_003_001: With great fanfare and jubilation, the Hiigarans were welcomed into the Palace of the Elder Sun.
* cinematic_003_002: The young Emperor, Cazoma, greeted them with intense interest.
Assailing them with questions, he welcomed the Hiigarans as guests within his domain.
* cinematic_003_003: But another resided as guests among the Tanoch. Introduced as a friend and fellow galactic traveller,
Cazoma revealed what could not be true.
* cinematic_003_004: Jochik Kaan: Son of Makaan, and Lord of the Vaygr.
* cinematic_004_001: The Vaygr's betrayal is complete. The Throne World of Tanoch is in flames. Cazoma, Emperor of the Tanoch people, is missing.
* cinematic_004_002: In this desperate hour the remaining leaders of the Tanoch turn to the Hiigarans. Placing their trust in the Hiigarans, they share what they know about the Vaygr.
* cinematic_004_003: The mounting evidence showed the Vaygr were here for a purpose, and they were close to seizing their objective....
* cinematic_004_004: ...an ancient facility, containing what may be one of the only Progenitor super weapons in existence.
* cinematic_004_005: We must stop the Vaygr before they can reach this facility and retreive the Progenitor weapon.
* cinematic_004_006: Hiigara itself may depend on us to stop them.
* cinematic_006_001: Recovered records from the Tanoch reveal little about the area of the Galaxy we are about to enter.
* cinematic_006_002: Their knowledge ends at a zone, that they have called the Nightmare Gulf.
* cinematic_006_003: The Zone is defined by a dense, dark nebula of enormous size.
* cinematic_006_004: We have also detected unusual quantum phenomena, which blocks normal hyperspace travel.
* cinematic_006_005: This kind of anomaly at this scale could have only been created by the Progenitors, possibly another scar from whatever cataclysm which destroyed their civilization.
* cinematic_006_006: There is no information about what lies beyond the zone. Not even myths...
* cinematic_006_007: Prepare for anything.
* cinematic_005_001: I am Vice Admiral Kidara Sasan, commanding Task Force Amalek. Our objective is to locate the gate nexus in this galaxy, secure it for the Hiigaran Empire, and unlock travel between our galaxy and this one.
* cinematic_005_002: I am convinced the ancient Amassari knew of its location. We have been scouring their structures in search of further evidence to point us in the right direction. Our next destination is their ancient capital of Hataldan.
* cinematic_005_003: Vice Admiral, the Progenitor ruins and Amassari structures on them here belong to the Amassari. I can't abide further attacks on their sovereignty with military force.
* cinematic_005_004: Your Kiith have the nerve to claim you respect the sovereignty of those who live here! The Amassari are in the way of the Hiigaran Empire. They will be swept aside, as all others have been, so we can claim our destiny.
* cinematic_005_005: Must the road to Hiigaran ascendancy be paved with the blood of innocents? These are their homes, Vice Admiral!
* cinematic_005_006: Where was this bleeding compassion when six hundred thousand Kushan invaders seized Hiigara? Your hypocrisy disgusts me. We are advancing on Hataldan. It's up to you if you want to follow.

* desc_qm_004: We are following Vaygr fleet to find out their hidden plan.
* qm_t0_tutmissions_end_dia_1: A hiigaran settlement? We should <color=#FBB03F>visit this Lazarus Station</color>. With luck, other missing expeditions to this galaxy made it there.
* qm_t0_introstation_end_dia_1: Greetings commander, I am Ekekko, a... merchant of the Iyatequa. I would like to seek passage aboard your vessel. In exchange for this transport, I can be your bargain hunter and local guide to this region. I take up little room, and in exchange I can open doors for you that would be closed otherwise.
* qm_t0_introstation_end_dia_2: Commander, the Iyatequa traders have a lot of local contacts in the vicinity. Access to what they know might be useful in the future. I’ve reviewed his proposal and it’s little effort to allow him and his cargo passage onboard. Security has already vetted his entry.
* qm_t0_introstation_end_dia_3: Well and met Commander, I am pleased to make your acquaintance and share your voyage. Please come by to visit my on-ship store to <color=#FBB03F>collect your first payment</color> now. In the future you may return any time to collect your daily fee. You are my first customer.
* qm_t0_intromarket_end_dia_1: Commander, welcome to Lazarus Base. Our apologies for being unable to respond to your distress signal at Wiracoda gate.
* qm_t0_intromarket_end_dia_2: We’ve had troubles from the local pirates. Your arrival has also agitated the Progenitor defenders in the region for reasons unknown.
* qm_t0_intromarket_end_dia_3: We would like to welcome you aboard to bring you up to speed about the situation here in the Nimbus galaxy, but we could use some help securing the local area.
* qm_t0_intromarket_end_dia_4: Acknowledged, Lazarus base. Commander, first we should re-equip our forces and <color=#FBB03F>build an interceptor squadron</color>. Our forces were thinned in the battle.
* qm_t0_introfabricator_end_dia_1: Very good. We need to <color=#FBB03F>ready the new fighters inside our hangars</color>.
* qm_t0_introequipstrikecraft_end_dia_1: Now that our interceptors are ready, we can <color=#FBB03F>scan the system</color> for hostile signals.
* qm_t0_introscanning_end_dia_1: We found something. Hostiles confirmed. <color=#FBB03F>Jump to the signal</color> to engage the enemies.
* qm_t0_introsignals_0_end_dia_1: All enemies destroyed in the vicinity. We should return to Lazarus base and check in with them.
* qm_t0_introsignals_end_dia_1: Thank you for the assist, Commander. We had a raid pass through here as well and our facilities are damaged. We’re asking local commanders to gather resources and supply material for our repairs. Once we’re repaired our port facilities can reopen to you.
* qm_t0_introsignals_end_dia_2: Scouts have already identified this system as being rich in the resources we need. It would help us if you could <color=#FBB03F>mine some ores</color> here and return them to us.
* qm_t0_v2_introscanning_0_end_dia_1: We've detected a hostile signature within the system. We need to <color=#FBB03F>analyze the signal</color> to gather more information.
* qm_t0_v2_introscanning_end_dia_1: Analysis of the signature completed. The location and additional information is tracked in our computers. <color=#FBB03F>Jump to the signal</color> to engage the enemies.
* qm_t0_v2_introsignals_0_end_dia_1: All enemies destroyed in the vicinity. We should return to Lazarus base and check in with them.
* qm_t0_v2_introsignals_end_dia_1: Thank you for the assist, Commander. We had a raid pass through here as well and our facilities are damaged. We’re asking local commanders to gather resources and supply material for our repairs. Once we’re repaired our port facilities can reopen to you.
* qm_t0_v2_introsignals_end_dia_2: Scouts have already identified this system as being rich in the resources we need. It would help us if you could <color=#FBB03F>mine some ores</color> here and return them to us.
* qm_t0_introscanbelts_0_end_dia_1: There are several potential mining sites, but the signatures are scattered. We'll we need to <color=#FBB03F>analyze the asteroid clusters</color> before we can initiate mining operations.
* qm_t0_introscanbelts_end_dia_1: Commander, we have located several mineral-rich asteroids. We can now <color=#FBB03F>jump to the cluster and use our resource collector to mine ores.</color>
* qm_t0_intromining_end_dia_1: That's it, we now should have enough ore. We should return and <color=#FBB03F>deliver the minerals to Lazarus Station</color>.
* qm_t0_support_end_dia_1: Resources received Commander, thank you. We have aboard Gideon S’jet, renowned Progenitor Expert and survivor of the original Caral expedition. He wishes to speak with you.
* qm_t0_support_end_dia_2: Commander, I am Gideon S’jet. I helped design the Progenitor Communicator you have aboard your vessel. I must assist your mission to explore Progenitor sites.
* qm_t0_support_end_dia_3: Gideon was the foremost expert in Progenitor sciences after Karan when he disappeared with the Caral expedition. His knowledge would be invaluable. We should <color=#FBB03F>assign Gideon S'jet to the bridge</color>.
* qm_t0_introbridge_end_dia_1: While assigned to the bridge, Gideon grants your flagship another combat skill, which can be activated during battle.
* qm_t0_introbridge_end_dia_2: Skills require energy to activate. While it will regenerate over time, you cannot activate any skills if your energy reserves are depleted. Choose wisely when and which skills to use.
* qm_t0_introbridge_end_dia_3: Thank you commander. I shall relocate myself and my team to your vessel. I advise you to build up your fleet, Progenitor ruins are not to be taken lightly.
* qm_t0_introbridge_end_dia_4: Dangerous is an understatement. Lazarus Base has offered the use of their shipyards, we should take advantage of this and <color=#FBB03F>build an assault frigate</color>.
* qm_t0_introshipyard_end_dia_1: The shipyard construction has finished. We need to <color=#FBB03F>ready our new frigate using the Fleet Configuration</color>.
* qm_t0_introequipescorts_end_dia_1: Commander, I have studied the after-action report of Wiracoda Gate. Something has changed among the Progenitor ruins in this galaxy, but I require more data before I can begin a useful analysis.
* qm_t0_introequipescorts_end_dia_2: I have colleagues in the local vicinity which may have more information than I have available. We should visit Baaekh S'jet first. I have sent the coordinates of her research lab to your navigation database.
* qm_t0_scientist_baaekh_a_0_end_dia_1: Commander, Baaekh S’jet is reported missing. She went on an expedition to the Saaret system and hasn't returned.
* qm_t0_scientist_baaekh_a_1_end_dia_1: There’s no sign of Baaekh. We should start scanning the area for her. Maybe she's located somewhere inside the extensive asteroid belt of this system.
* qm_t0_scientist_baaekh_a_2_end_dia_1: Commander, this is Baaekh S’jet. I am being hunted by hostile craft. Please take care of them, I cannot help you until then.
* qm_t0_scientist_baaekh_a_end_dia_1: We have located the hostile forces that have Baaekh S'jet pinned down. We'll engage them at your order, Commander.
* qm_t0_scientist_baaekh_b_0_end_dia_1: Thank you commander. I had no means of escape without your assistance. I can provide you the data you seek if you return me to the research station in Iniim.
* qm_t0_scientist_baaekh_b_end_dia_1: Thank you for returning me safely. Here is your data. We found coordinates to a progenitor ruin which might be useful for you.
* qm_t0_scientist_baaekh_b_end_dia_2: Thank you. Commander, I have sent the coordinates of the ruin into the navigation database.
* qm_t0_relic_0_end_dia_1: Commander, we must scan this system to locate the relic's signature.
* qm_t0_relic_1_end_dia_1: Relic signature detected. Coordinates locked. We'll investigate on your command.
* qm_t0_relic_2_end_dia_1: The relic has yielded some interesting information, but unfortunately no answers. I will send the coordinates to my second colleague into the navigation database.
* qm_t0_scientist_hyeaa_a_0_end_dia_1: Commander, Gideon has informed me you are seeking information. I am willing to help, but we are currently running low on resources. What do you say, you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours?
* qm_t0_scientist_hyeaa_a_end_dia_1: Yes, this will do. I am transmitting my research data as we speak.
* qm_t0_scientist_hyeaa_a_end_dia_2: Commander, this looks very promising. With this data I have traced a progenitor command signal back to Toasiim. We should find a Progenitor Relic generating this signal there.
* qm_t0_scientist_hyeaa_b_0_end_dia_1: I see the rapid construction techniques have scantly improved in my absence, save for materials allocation and allotment. How little we’ve improved over even the past century.
* qm_t0_scientist_hyeaa_b_end_dia_1: Thank you commander. I am giving you my conclusions based on my studies here of Progenitor manufacturing. There are some techniques you may find useful for future modifications.
* qm_t0_scientist_hyeaa_b_end_dia_2: Commander, I have traced a progenitor command signal back to Toasiim. We should find a Progenitor Relic generating this signal there.
* qm_t0_jolja_0_end_dia_1: The progenitor terminal must be somewhere in this system. We should perform some scans to find it.
* qm_t0_jolja_1_end_dia_1: We're picking up the right signature. We're on the right track. I locked in the coordinates. We should go there and find it.
* qm_t0_jolja_end_dia_1: Commander, your star is rising among our people, and we wish to know <color=#FBB03F>what Kiith you declare allegiance for</color>. Declaring for a Kiith will bring other survivors of that Kiith to your fleet, along with their gifts.
* qm_t0_pickkiith_end_dia_1: Excellent. The old structures are still strong, but new systems are beginning to emerge. Maybe you want to join a clan as well.
* qm_t0_pickkiith_end_dia_2: Commander, while you are listed as the ship's captain, Admiral Enoch is still considered our commanding officer, which...
* qm_t0_pickkiith_end_dia_3: What I'm trying to say is that you should <color=#FBB03F>register your name</color> in the admiralty board computer. Then you will be officially recognized as our leading flag officer.
* qm_t0_pickname_end_dia_1: We have completed upgrades to the hyperspace module. With greater power we can overcome the strange gravity anomalies that litter this galaxy.
* qm_t0_pickname_end_dia_2: First we should consider joining a clan. Having close allies is important, after all. But it's your call, commander.
* qm_t3_gasmining_0_end_dia_1: Now that we have built a gas collector, we can send it into jovians to harvest useful gases.
* qm_t3_gasmining_0_end_dia_2: To do so, simply move it into the outer atmospheric layer of a gas planet. It will start collection automatically.
* qm_t3_gasmining_0_end_dia_3: But we need to be careful. Deeper layers will deal more <color=#FBB03F>damage</color> to our craft. Don't send it in too deep!

* m_iyafal_day4_log_header: Captain’s Log, Mahel Manaan
* m_iyafal_day4_log_body: Day 547
When I was a boy, my father would tell me stories of the Trader’s Bargain. Long gone now, I can picture that lone standing stone at the edge of the Shiiaro Mountains. The Manaan remember it as a promise of the joy to come. Now, I think of how solitary it was standing above the sands alone.
* m_iyafal_day8_log_header: Captain’s Log, Mahel Manaan
* m_iyafal_day8_log_body: Day 562
Today I’m reminded of an old saying among us Manaani. Fourteen days, fourteen turns, and fourteen hundred lost to that day on the dancing sands. Such a joyous day that changed our people so dramatically and without warning.
* m_iyafal_day12_log_header: Captain’s Log, Mahel Manaan
* m_iyafal_day12_log_body: Day 577
It is said the Kaalel have no true friends, but every one is a true friend to the Manaan. I can’t think of a better way to describe my time among these Iyatequa: The lone Manaan against these secret-keepers. But the old Manaan adage is still true: the slight of hand is more powerful than anything any coin could ever buy. Now is a war between magicians.
* m_anniversary_enoch_log_header: Personal Log, Enoch S’jet
* m_anniversary_enoch_log_body: Date: 10.8.9641

I struggle to find the words to define this moment. This should be a cause for celebration, a triumph of exploration, and a furthering of Hiigaran knowledge as we push back the boundary of the unknown. No great discovery is made without plenty of failure, but those great words sound differently now, as an Admiral in command of thousands about to embark into the unknown.

I look at this roster of vessels under my command and find myself thinking of the men and women I will now be responsible for, our mission, and the failure rate of these expeditions. Under the direction of the Daiamid and the vision from Karan S’jet herself, we press on to uncover more secrets of the Progenitors. But it’s hard to imagine how our expedition will truly succeed where so many others vanish without a trace, especially ones bound for this universe.

But go we must. There’s too much at stake riding on us not knowing what lay on the other side. We know Makaan sent vessels through this gate and we must learn what became of them. If there’s a threat to Hiigara looming out there, it must be stopped, or at least investigated. We’ve fought for so long and so hard to just ignore this. So, we go.

Though if we fail... none will know of our fate. We’ll be another few thousand sacrificed to this endeavor. What memorial will be erected in our memory? How will be honored by the people who sent us? I already know this new Daiamid is only using us as fodder for their ambitions. There will be no ceremony for us on Hiigara.

So if we are to go, I pray we can survive whatever fate stopped so many and find a future for our people. We have been exiles before, if we must be so again, so be it. I can only wish that someday, some of our number survives the command of the Daiamid and makes it home again to tell of our story.
* m_tanwin_2023_d01_log_header: The Chicuat
* m_tanwin_2023_d01_log_body: Originally the Chicuat were secular thinkers and visionaries in the early days of Tanochet’s interstellar travels. They had considered the ruins of the Makers as the tools of mortals, rather than divine engines of creation, and began to question the nature of long-held beliefs. Seen with envy and revolution by the pious Tanoch, it sparked the first interstellar conflict between the people of Tanochet.

State-sponsored propaganda has characterized the Chicuat as an irreverent, heretical, scheming people. They are often cast as the villains in far-ranging conspiracy theories with designs to topple the empire and destroy the Tanoch religion. This is far from the truth, as the Chicuat are merely trying to live in the margins provided, but they make for a convenient enemy the Empire frequently uses to oppress any perceived dissent.
* m_tanwin_2023_d06_log_header: The Tecuban
* m_tanwin_2023_d06_log_body: The Tecuban enter the oral history of the Tanoch as slaves taken from the northern continent in ancient times. A hardy but downtrodden people, the Tecuban have been historically dismissed as dim-witted menials and peasants by the rest of the Tanoch population. This state-sported mischaracterization has kept the Tecuban from attaining much beyond their segregated portions in the Tanoch Empire. Their numbers increased as they took in victims of the Empire’s early conquests, and they now lend their name and culture to an underclass spanning across the Empire.

Recently the Tecuban have welcomed strangers that claim to be from outside the galaxy. For the first time in living memory they have been promised the chance to rise above their station by joining with these outsiders and conquering for themselves.
* m_tanwin_2023_d11_log_header: The Second Homeworld War
* m_tanwin_2023_d11_log_body: This pivotal conflict in Galactic Standard Year 9625 shaped the galaxy with its ramifications. The seeds of the conflict began when the Warlord Makaan located a Progenitor Far-Jump Hyperspace Core- the third one to be found. Knowing that one was in possession of the enigmatic Bentusi and the other were held by the Hiigarans, he embarked on a war to claim all three and declare himself heir to the Progenitor legacy.

With the power of a far-jump hyperspace core to fuel his conquest, Makaan smashed the Taiidan Republic and began an overwhelming assault on the rest of the galactic core. The force of his attack shattered the unity of the Galactic Council, and only the leadership and dedication of the Hiigarans managed to prevent the galaxy from being overrun. In order to stop Makaan, the legendary figure Karan S’jet emerged from seclusion to personally lead the force to defeat him.

Karan embarked on a voyage to discover the whereabouts of Sajuuk, which according to prophecy was where the three Progenitor Cores must be united. Along the way she received the Bentusi’s final gift, the first core, and raced to the center of the galaxy. There she and Makaan engaged in one final duel to the death, with the winner claiming the legacy of the Progenitors. Karan emerged victorious, ushering in the Age of S’jet.
* m_tanwin_2023_d17_log_header: Jochik Kaan
* m_tanwin_2023_d17_log_body: Disturbingly little is known about Jochik Kaan, the boy who claims to be the son of Makaan and heir to his rightful destiny. Up until now it was not known whether Makaan had any family.

Ostensibly Makaan’s second son with an unknown concubine, Jochik and the rest of Makaan’s Crusade were sent to the Nimbus Galaxy by Makaan for safekeeping while he fought against the Hiigarans. Evidently Jochik managed to climb his way to leadership of the Crusade and hatch a long-term plan in Nimbus. His confidence and haughtiness when facing the Hiigarans can only suggest he has a plan and is confident about its execution.

Hiigaran Intelligence has been unable to discern the purpose of his plan, as not even his own lieutenants seem to know, but it appears Jochik has a keen interest in specific Progenitor components. He is observed seeking specific parts or components, possibly to restore a Progenitor ruin, but what that ruin is and to what end is unknown. The only other detail of note is how personally connected he is to the ruler of the Tanoch Empire. By all accounts, the two appear to be close friends, and Jochik is given free run of the Imperial palace.
* m_tanwin_2023_d22_log_header: Toci's Letter
* m_tanwin_2023_d22_log_body: Commander,

I cannot clearly express with words in your language how much your assistance means to me and my people. The Chicuat have always been persecuted, harassed, and scapegoated through Tanoch history. For the first time in living memory, we have allies, and we have a chance of stopping the abuse at last. We begin small but there is hope now where there was none before.

Of course there is no news across the Empire of our victory, no word of the Vaygr, or the artifacts they tried to steal. Inconvenient things like the truth often disappear in the Empire while it is dominated by this ruthless theocracy. We all know the real power behind the throne, and it concerns me more why the Temple forces are not responding to Vaygr influence. The Empire may not be oblivious to our struggle after all.

In the end, all that matters is that my people are now safe and standing. Thanks to you we now have the means to provide for ourselves and find a way forward to our own greatness and self determination someday.

From myself and all the Chicuat people, we thank you.

Toci Citalicue

Missile Barrage for example requires at least one missile turret to be equipped on your flagship. Skills will also be greyed out if you don't have enough energy to use them, or if there are no enemies in range.

If you activate a skill, the skill needs to recharge, indicated by the skill icon filling up from the left to the right side.

* glossary.scanning.title: Scanning
* glossary.scanning.text.intro: To find systems in the galaxy or missions and belts in systems, you have to find and analyze them first.
* glossary.scanning.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title: Detecting & Analyzing
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.intro: Scanning is generally divided into detecting and analyzing. While detection reveals just the location and some basic information, analyzing will, once completed, reveal all information on the object to you.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.finding: Detection
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.finding: When you first enter a new system, you will not have any signals in the target list.

If you tap the scanning icon in the center of the main scanning UI you will send out a ping in the system, that will reveal the location of signals. Your first scanner will reveal three signals at a time, while a scanner of a higher tier will reveal more and more objects at once.

Detecting costs 5% of your scanner charge.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.analyzing: Analyzing
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.analyzing: Once you have found an object, you need to analyze it to show all the details in the target list. To analyze a signal, belt or any other object, you need tap it in the target list, and then tap on analyze.

Every time you tap analyze, it will cost 5% of your scanner charge. Then, the scanner will roll a number between your Scanning Reliability and your Scanner Strength which it will then add to your analysis progress.

Furthermore, there is a crit chance of 5% which will add double the current Analyzing Strength to your analyzing progress.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.header.stats: Scanning Stats
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.stats: This section will go over all the stats regarding your scanner.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.detection: Detection Power
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.detection: The detection power of your scanner is a threshold that determines if your scanner is powerful enough to find objects. If the detection power is larger than the signal needs, your scanner will detect and reveal it for you to analyze. Every time you scan to detect a signal, it will drain your detection power as it is linked to your scanner charge. Recharging your scanner will increase your detection power again.

The Detection Power ceiling can be increased by upgrading the scanner.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.count: Detection Count
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.count: The detection count is the number of signals your scanner can reveal. Higher tier scanners have a higher detection count natively.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.charge: Charge
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge1: The scanner charge determins how often you can scan for objects or analyze objects you have already found.

The overal charge can go from 0% to 150%, where everything above 100% is called overcharging.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge2: Overcharging can only be achieved when consuming a battery, while below 100% the scanner recharges itself with a rate of 3% per minute.

Depending on your current scanner charge, the UI bar will change the color to the object rarity your scanner can potentially find in the system.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge3: Above you can see the state of your scanner charge in several differently tiered system. The first image is in a T0 system. As T0 does not have any Rare or Epic objects, only the Common rarity is displayed. The second image shows a a T1 system. As only rare objects exists only rarities until Rare are displayed. Finally, in the third image, T2 systems and higher may inhabit epic objects, the scanner will now also display the epic charge.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge4: The detection power threshold for every rarity can be lowered by upgrading the scanner that is currently equipped on your flagship. In the two images above, the right image has a higher scanner level than the left. The thresholds for each rarity is thus much lower.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge5: If you visit a system that is below the tier of your scanner, the thresholds will be a lot lower. This means, that in most cases, your scanner is so powerful that it can detect most rarities with any charge.
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.reliabilitystrength: Analyzing Reliability & Strength
* glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.reliabilitystrength: Analyzing Reliability is the base of your scanning roll, whereas Strength is the ceiling. Once you analyze an object, the scanner will have a random roll between your scanners reliability and the strength and then add this to your analyzing progress.

Both stats can be increased by either upgrading your scanner, by adding officers with the correct stat to the bridge or the module slot, or mounting internal modules.
* glossary.exploration.text.intro: Exploration is a big part of Homeworld. There is something to discover in every system.
* glossary.systemview.text.intro: Scanning is an integral part of the game. As you enter an unknown galaxy, you need to discover most missions and objects in space.
Scanning can be divided into scanning the galaxy, and scanning of systems. Several systems first need to be discovered and then analyzed before you are able to enter them.

Systems can contain all sorts of missions and hidden objects. To find them you first need to scan in the system, and then analyze the objects or missions to see the details.
* glossary.systemview.title.targetlist: Target List

For detecting and analyzing they follow the same rules as signals.
* glossary.scanning.scanningbatteries.title: Batteries
* glossary.scanningbatteries.text.intro: While the charge of your scanner rechargers over time, it will only ever charge back up to 100%.

To find higher rarity objects, you need to overcharge your scanner. The only way to do this is to use a battery. This will add extra charge to your scanner and allows it to detect rarer objects.

Currently, common batteries or blueprints for higher rarities can drop from signal missions.
* glossary.scanningbatteries.title.rarities: Battery Rarities
* glossary.scanningbatteries.text.rarities: Depending on the rarity of the battery, it recharges the scanner more, the higher the rarity. Currently, the recharge rate are:

If you have equipped more than one refinery module, you will see those here on the left as well.
* glossary.flagshiprefining.title.stats: Refinery Stats
* glossary.flagshiprefining.text.stats: The stats of your refinery are on the left, next to the selection tabs. Here you can find all the important stats of the currently selected refinery module, like your refinery time multiplyer, the rare earth chance and rare earth output amount.
* glossary.flagshiprefining.title.rareearth: Rare Earth
* glossary.flagshiprefining.text.rareearth: Rare Earth are a byproduct of refining. For each tier of ore there are different more common and rarer rare earths. These can be used to upgrade your internal and external modules, making them more effective.

The base chance to receive rare earth after refining one batch (200 ore) is 20% with a payout of 15 RE. You can improve this chance with better refineries or specialized officers. It is better to start larger refining jobs as the chances to receive rare earth even out with a bigger amount of ore.
* glossary.flagshiprefining.title.refining: Refining Process
* glossary.flagshiprefining.text.refining1: To start the refining process, tap the big plus in the center of the screen. If you do not have sufficient raw resources in your storage or your stash, a warning will be shown.
* glossary.flagshiprefining.text.refining2: After you selected the raw resources you want to refine, a slider to select the amount is displayed in the center of the screen as well as a detailed breakdown of the refinery process on the right.
* glossary.flagshiprefining.text.refining3: The basic ratio for ore to refined metal is 2 to 1 - meaing that 200 ore will always make 100 refined materials.

This ratio can be improved either with better refineries or with officers that have specialized passive skills.
* glossary.flagshiprefining.text.refining4: Depending on the tier of the ore and the tier of the refinery, an additional time cost penalty will be applied. This means that once you have the chance of fabricating a better refinery, it will save you a lot of process time in future.
* glossary.flagshiprefining.title.refinefromstash: Refining From Stash

Here you can mandate the construction of large escort ships and flagships. Once they are finished, you again need to visit a station to collect these ships.

You do not have access to a shipyard if you are not at a station.

The shipyard also does not have an officer slot. It will however be improved by officers you put on your bridge.
* glossary.flagshipfabrication.title.blueprints: Blueprints
* glossary.flagshipfabrication.text.blueprints: To fabricate an item, you first need to find a blueprint.

Blueprints are the instructions your engineers need to fabricate an item. You can find blueprints nearly everywhere: As an assignment reward, in one of the many markets or even as a reward for completing missions.

Blueprints can be limited or unlimited. Common blueprints are always unlimited, while uncommon, rare and epic blueprints are limited.
Limited blueprints can only be built once as they are consumed.

If a fabrication process is running, you currently cannot view all other blueprints you own.

<color=#FBB03F>Caution: If you abort an ongoing fabrication process, you will lose the blueprint.</color>.

* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.title.mainstorage: Storage
* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.text.mainstorage: In the center of the screen you can find your storage.

The storage is divided into several categories. Here, items are split into item stacks that can have different sizes.

Ships and modules can only have one item per stack, refined materials 10.000 and raw resources 1.000 units.

You can also collapse the categories by tapping the small triangle on the top right.
* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.title.newitem: New Items
* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.text.newitem: New items in your storage will have a tiny orange breadcrumb. They will also be sorted into the New category that is always at the top of your storage.
* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.title.capacity: Capacity
* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.text.capacity: Your flagship storage can only hold a certain amount of item stacks.

If your storage is full, you will no longer be able to jump to missions or strikes. However, you can still jump to outposts and stations so that you can empty your storage.

To increase the storage space, you can mount storage modules in your internal module space.

Keep in mind that your storage is universal across flagships. This means, that items will transfer from one to another flagship if you change loadouts. However, you might end up overburdened if the storage space of the flagship you switched to is smaller than the one before.
* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.header.stash: Stash
* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.text.stash: Whereas the storage is limited, the stash is not. This means that in your stash you can have an unlimited amount of items.

You can either access the stash directly via the station menu, or when you are in the storage menu on the left side.

Different to the storage, resources like ore and refined materials will be moved into one large stack that is unlimited in size. So, instead of three stacks of 10.000 refined material you will have one stack with 30.000 refined materials.
* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.text.itemstacks: On the left you have 9000 ore in the storage, divided into nine stacks, and on the right the same amount as one stack in the stash.
* glossary.flagshipstoragestash.title.movingitems: Moving Items

* glossary.flagshipturrets.text.swapturrets1: To mount or change a turret with one from your storage, tap the Change Module button. A selection screen will open where you can choose what module you would like to mount there. The selection is already filtered, meaning that if you try to mount a turret to a medium slot, only medium turrets will be displayed in the selection menu.
* glossary.flagshipturrets.text.swapturrets2: Once you opened the selection screen for turrets, pay close attention to the item card of the turret. If a turret is already mounted to another flagship, a letter of the corresponding loadout will appear.
* glossary.flagshipturrets.text.swapturrets3: In this example, the small letter B in the lower-left corner indicates that the turret is already mounted on the flagship in loadout B.
* glossary.flagshipexternal.flagshipsensors.title: Sensors
* glossary.flagshipsensors.text.intro: The sensor is an external module responsible for detecting and analyzing signals or other objects in Nimbus, as well as finding and revealing ships in missions or belts.

It is a very important module and should be upgraded whenever possible.

* glossary.factionwar.title: The Sarassian Wars
* glossary.factionwar.text.intro: The Sarassian Sea is home to many neutron stars, which make it dangerous for long term colonization as strong neutron storms wipe most of the region clean every four weeks.

Yet, despite the dangers, three different factions have decided to settle the Sarassian Sea in order to access the rare resources within.

Naturally, the Sarassian Sea attracts plenty of outlaws from all across the galaxy, using the neutron storms as a cover while they hunt after the resources and convoys for themselves. The three factions claiming this space offer handsome rewards to anyone who helps them secure their borders by expelling the outlaws.

Once a Sarassian War season ends, anyone pledged to the dominant faction is granted that season’s end reward, and the neutron storms reset the entire area, ready for the next season.
* glossary.factionwar.title.providers: The Guild of Providers
* glossary.factionwar.text.providers: The Guild is a self-professed subgroup of the Iyatequa Traders with a unique focus on exploration and daring adventures. Though the rest of the Iyatequa do not speak of them openly, the Guild is eager to recruit others into their extensive pursuits.
* glossary.factionwar.title.collective: The Zatozi Collective
* glossary.factionwar.text.collective: This small, family-owned venture comes from within the Tanoch Empire, operating out of Teozacoz. Recently they have dedicated their business to exploring and mining the Sarassian Sea. Modest in their outlook and honest in their aspirations, the Zatozi are driven by economic necessity as much as the desire for profit.
* glossary.factionwar.title.enterprise: The Sogamoso Enterprise
* glossary.factionwar.text.enterprise: A private corporation controlled by Elder Sagipa - one of the eight largest economic entities in the Yaot Federation. They are subcontracting Hiigaran captains to explore and secure the region, in part to trial working with the Hiigarans for future economic ventures.
* glossary.factionwar.factionwarfactions.title: Factions
* glossary.factionwarfactions.title.sarassiansea: The Sarrasian Sea
* glossary.factionwarfactions.text.sarassiansea: The Sarassian Sea is located some distance away, to the North-West, from the Tanoch Empire and beyond the Karagan Shoals. The region is a bit of a mystery to the known empires in the local region, known for a long time as a location in myth before Cangacian Scouts discovered safe hyperspace routes into the zone. The Sarassian Sea thus has not seen the millennia of conquest and colonization found in the local area.

For a long time the only settlers in the region are the furthest known Cangaican pirates fleeing the Tanoch Empire. They have had centuries to try navigating the Sarassian sea’s unusual properties, with many ships lost over time before the precise shielding methods could be devised. Even then, the constant polarity shifting from the nearby neutron stars makes computer technology unreliable. Most space settlements have had to fall back on more primitive means of maintaining their technology - computer use is reduced.

The Sarassian sea is characterized by very unusual Neutron stars located in the region. These emission stars broadcast on odd frequencies and as a result, frequently disrupt un-shielded computer systems and distort navigation data. That they are located in this region specifically is one of the many oddities about the Nimbus Galaxy itself. Due to the neutron stars, or in spite of them, the Sarassian sea is home to many rich and hard to find resources.

But where there are riches, there are dangers. The power of said neutrons sweeps through the region, cleansing it with extreme radiation bursts every four weeks precisely.
* glossary.factionwarfactions.title.providers: The Guild of Providers
* glossary.factionwarfactions.text.providers: Very little is known about the interior arrangement of the Iyatequa traders; how they are organized, factions within the larger organization, and personal allegiances. The Iyatequa are usually very tight-lipped about this. But one recent and very glaring exception is the Guild of Providers, which began soliciting aid for ventures to the Sarassian Sea. Their agents are easily spotted from among the Iyatequa traders by the bold teal sashes they wear marked with the logo of the Guild.

The relationship the guild holds with the rest of the Iyatequa is, putting it succinctly, remarkable. The traders never speak of the guild on their own, and is one of the only known lines of inquiry which would leave a tradesmen speechless. One is left with the sense that the Guild is controversial within the Iyatequa themselves- though not anything worthy of sanction or disapproval.

The Guild pays ship crews well for venturing into the Sarassian sea to retrieve objects for their behalf. Though they are only a recent Iyatequa phenomenon, they are becoming one of the more reputable areas of dealing with the tradesmen. Officers of the Guild rarely try to oversell or cajole services, they are among the most straightforward, professional negotiators of the Iyatequa.
* glossary.factionwarfactions.title.collective: The Zatozi Collective
* glossary.factionwarfactions.text.collective: Much of the Tanoch Empire’s resources and material needs are governed through a command economy, in which mines are commissioned and governed by state officials appointed by the Emperor’s bureau of economics. The Tanoch Empire overall directs and organizes regional labor towards goals of the Empire on a regional level. One exception to this is the Calpolli, or Collective.

A Tanoch collective is a collection of families connected either by blood or long association. These structures predate and persist in spite of the empire, serving more like social organizations and groupings for specific, stated purposes. A Collective could be organized for the construction of artisan spacecraft, or providing food and repairs across an entire quadrant. They are like a Kiith in that they are organized around a purpose, but unlike a Kiith they are not all bound by blood or consist of one family. A Collective has their own celebrations and culture, but it is not strong enough to be distinct from the broader Tanoch society. A Collective is lead by an individual Calpolec, who is elected for life. As these structures predate the rise of the modern Tanoch Empire, many of them are traditionally headed by a female Calpolec.

The Zatozi Collective exists on the fringe of Tanoch Space within Centeotl, based on Teozacoz. Primarily consisting of ethnic Tanoch, they often suffer opposition from the Chiucat who outnumber them in the region. Nevertheless, they can count on state support for assistance, as the Empire is always quick to help those of Tanoch descent.

The Zatozi have recently appointed a new Calpolec, Cozcaua, who has made it his mission to mine the Sarassian Sea. The Collective lacks equipment of their own, so Cozcaua is subcontracting spacers and crews to mine on behalf of the Collective . These crews and spacers go and gather the resources, and in exchange the Zatozi Collective gives them some kind of legal protection and service in the eyes of the Tanoch Empire. Though crews employed by the Zatozi are not literally employed by the Tanoch Empire, it’s the closest one will have to official Tanoch service within the Sarassian.
* glossary.factionwarfactions.title.enterprise: The Sogamoso Enterprise
* glossary.factionwarfactions.text.enterprise: Many of the old families in the Yaot Federation have various vices and ambitions; the wealthier and older the family the more esoteric the venture, usually. The Sogamoso family is no different, having a tendency to pursue great mysteries of Yaot mythology and history. The Sogamoso’s feats include locating three of the five Pillars, discovering the location of the Vendu, recovering a vessel of the First Fleet, and charting two thirds of the hyperspace gates located in Yaot territory.

Recently the Sogamoso have turned their attention to the Sarassian sea. Elder Sagipa has long been fascinated with the region, and now has the political pull within the Federation council to sanction his interest in the region. To save costs and preserve his own military assets, he is offsetting the costs by extending a contract specifically to Hiigaran ship captains to explore and mine the area. Many believe it is to set up future expeditions with the hope of building Yaot-alligned way-stations in the region. Others believe he is acting in the interests of the Federation by establishing bases on the far side of Tanoch space for a strategic advantage.

Because of the reach and breadth of the Sogamoso, they have their own currency and officers. They are one of eight large families within the Yaot Federation, and one of three to issue their own currency. The power of their prestige is large enough that they can elevate themselves above Yaot society in this way, making them a kind of sub-class to the upper classes and elite.

Afterwards, the Sarassian Sea is reset back to its starting state and all emitters are removed from players' inventories. Use them or lose them!

Between seasons there is a short off-season time, lasting for only one to three days, depending on the month. You may still access the Sarassian market during that time and visit the Sarassian market, but the other systems are off-limits due to the neutron storms.

* glossary.factionwarseasons.text.cycles: Each season runs for four cycles, with each cycle being seven days in length.

At the end of a cycle, members of the dominant faction receive their cycle rewards and each player receives their Sarassian Credits, determined by the influence they gained by completing missions and their pledge strength.

Sarassian Credits can be turned in for items and resources in the Sarassian market.
* glossary.factionwar.factionwarpledging.title: Pledging
* glossary.factionwarpledging.text.intro: Each player can pledge to one of the three Sarassian factions. This pledge will stay for the remainder of the season and cannot be changed until the season is over.

Each pledge has a strength, based on the dominance score of the faction and/or the number of players already pledged to that faction. The pledge strength determines a player’s payout of Sarassian Credits at the end of each cycle. The higher your pledge strength, the more Sarassian Credits you will receive for your contribution of that cycle.

The pledge strength has no bearing on the season’s end reward, but a faction that has more players or a higher dominance score, and as such is more likely to win, will also offer a lower pledge strength. The factions will not pay you extra when they are already about to win!
* glossary.factionwar.factionwarinfluence.title: Influence
* glossary.factionwarinfluence.text.intro: Whenever a Sarassian signal has been completed, the system gains an amount of influence dictated by that signal’s tier.

Once a faction reaches 50% of the total influence in a system, it will gain ownership over that system. Additionally, it will receive a fortification bonus, making it harder for the other factions to take over that system.

At the beginning of a season, all systems will start out neutral, with equal amounts of influence for each faction.
* glossary.factionwarinfluence.title.decay: Influence Decay
* glossary.factionwarinfluence.text.decay: Influence decays over time, the rate of which is different for each tier. Decay happens for every faction and is a set amount. Nevertheless, decay can never remove the ownership of a system, even if the influence points of each faction reaches zero.
* glossary.factionwar.factionwaremitters.title: Signal Emitters
* glossary.factionwaremitters.text.intro: Key to gain contribution points and helping your faction win are signal emitters. Signal emitters are special beacons that emulate distress calls or other communications that will attract pirates and other outlaws. Once placed, a signal emitter will create a set of signal missions . For some of these emitters, the number of signals are limited, while others keep luring in more pirates until they break down.

Emitters cannot be destroyed, but they do disappear after a set amount of time.

Only players of your own faction can see and play missions generated by a signal emitter.
* glossary.factionwaremitters.title.emittertypes: Emitter Types
* glossary.factionwaremitters.text.emittertypes: There are four different emitters that can be used to generated missions.
The common emitter is the simplest one, generating one missions for you or any other faction member to complete.

The uncommon emitter generates five missions just for you to complete.

The rare emitter generates five missions every 10 minutes for 60 minutes that you or any member of your faction can complete.

The epic emitter generates 2 missions every minute for 60 minutes, also for you or any of your faction member.
* glossary.factionwaremitters.title.placingemitters: Placing Emitters
* glossary.factionwaremitters.text.placingemitters: Whenever you complete a mission generated by a signal emitter, you gain a number of contribution points and the system will gain influence points. Both are based on the tier of the mission.

When you place a signal emitter and another player completes a mission generated with it, you also receive a small amount of contribution points.
* glossary.factionwaremitters.title.emittersgameplayloop: Completing Emitter Signals
* glossary.factionwaremitters.text.emittersgameplayloop: The missions generated by an emitter are similar to the signal missions you can find throughout the Nimbus galaxy. However, they do not give specific rewards, as the main reward from each emitter mission is the influence gained.
* glossary.factionwar.factionwardominance.title: Dominance
* glossary.factionwardominance.text.intro: Each system grants their owning faction dominance points. At the end of a cycle, the total dominance points from all systems will be counted per faction and added to that faction’s dominance score.

All members of the dominant faction receive a +15% XP bonus from all sources.

Dominance score is only calculated at the end of a cycle. If a faction receives enough dominance points to make it dominant at the end of the cycle, it will not receive that bonus until the end of the cycle. The green number displayed in the faction overview is only a preview of what the faction would receive if it managed to hold all the territory it currently owns.

During each cycle, only one faction will be dominant. If there is a tie, no faction is dominant.
* glossary.factionwar.factionwarfortification.title: Fortification
* glossary.factionwarfortification.text.intro: Whenever a faction takes over a system, it receives a fortification bonus, that adds a relative amount of influence to the total influence of the system. This additional influence does not decay and is a percentage of the total influence.

For example, a fortification bonus of 15% will always make the system’s influence bar be filled by 15% for the owning faction.

This fortification does not decrease as other factions gain more influence. A fortification of 15% will always stay 15%. The only way to get rid of a fortification is to take over the system entirely.

While fortification cannot be reduced, it will naturally grow together with the system owner’s relative influence. For example, if the relative influence (without fortification) reaches 70%, then the fortification rises to 21%.

The capital system of each faction starts each season already fully under the control of their faction. This means they will naturally have a 30% fortification bonus from the start.

## Dialogs:
* dia_iyafal_2023_day01_end_1: We have information the Palantine Light was often traveling with an Iyatequa ship, the Checkered Mule. We’re still gathering information.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day02_end_1: Some of these containers match the Palantine Light manifest, but they were likely sold. We’re trying to back-track sales history with the Iyatequa now.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day03_end_1: What are we going to do with all of these items? Sell them?
* dia_iyafal_2023_day03_end_2: The Iyatequa have been asking us the same question.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day04_end_1: Commander, we found a log buoy from the Palatine Light. Only one message was found, I’ve sent it to your inbox so you can look at it privately.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day05_end_1: Mahel rarely talked about Kharakid history to outsiders or the Iyatequa. Whatever he meant, I’d guess it’s a message only other Hiigarans would know.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day06_end_1: We have to be the most decorated unit in the fleet by now.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day06_end_2: If we ever get home they’ll probably give us even more medals to put somewhere.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day07_end_1: We’re running out of postings for senior officers. Somehow we’ll need either more ships, or bigger ones.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day08_end_1: Commander, one of these Progenitor artifacts has a message on it encoded in old Kushan. I’ve passed it to your inbox.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day09_end_1: Mahel’s logs both make reference to the Ferin Sha, a festival on old Kharak. A massacre occurred there in ancient times… Mahel is trying to tell us something.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day10_end_1: One of the containers had an anomalous data disk, also encoded in old Kushan. We’re decoding it now.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day11_end_1: We’ve decoded what looks like navigational data. It’s encoded in an odd format, cryptography is looking into it.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day12_end_1: Commander, the navigational data needs to be decoded with a Progenitor transponder. There was also a message included, it’s in your inbox now.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day13_end_1: We asked around for the component we need, but for some reason the Iyatequa aren’t selling any. The absence is too coincidental to be a coincidence.
* dia_iyafal_2023_day14_end_1: One of the relics we recovered is the Progenitor transponder we need. Using it to align the map we’ve located Mahel’s location!
* dia_iyafal_2023_day15_end_1: Captain Mahel is in our fleet now to protect him and use his skills. Although the traders have given up, we have a bigger problem now. Command will get back to us once we know more.
* dia_iyafal_2023_epi01_end_1: The resources gathered here could be useful for buying information. We need to confirm if the command codes are out.
* dia_iyafal_2023_epi02_end_1: If the other powers get the Progenitor codes working, we could be facing these in droves.
* dia_iyafal_2023_epi03_end_1: We’ll need every experienced officer we can get for what’s to come. The Progenitors are an enemy on an entirely different level.
* dia_iyafal_2023_epi04_end_1: Our newer officers didn’t serve in the war against the Vaygr. This refresher course showed them what we’ll be facing.
* dia_iyafal_2023_epi05_end_1: We’re going to need to mass our firepower for larger operations. Progenitor ships are the hardest adversary we’ve ever faced… we will need to be prepared for the worst to come.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day01_a_end_1: Commander, the transmission from Lazarus contains secret information on Progenitor technology. Details are classified, but I'll need you to investigate a list of certain items.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day01_a_end_2: The transmission has a priority directive attached to it, making these our official new orders. Let us begin immediately.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day01_b_end_1: Excellent. We have harvested many required items from destroyed wreckages. Now I need you to find an intact Progenitor Cognition Node.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day01_b_end_2: Commander, Gideon's secrecy can only mean he's working on something important. I wonder where his research will lead us.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day01_c_end_1: Thank you, Commander. I will start my research on the Progenitor Cognition Node. I need you to acquire more components in the meantime. I left a list with your adjutant.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day01_c_end_2: Commander, reading the list Gideon left us, I do not recognize any of these items. Maybe Ekekko, our liaison with the Iyatequa, can help us find them.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day02_a_end_1: Splendid, my friend. Splendid! These resources should be sufficient to make the right inquiries about ancient objects. I'll put out feelers, as they say.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day02_a_end_2: I have an uneasy feeling about Ekekko's contacts. I hope we can make the right impression.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day02_b_end_1: You're in luck, friend! I managed to find a seller for some of the parts you are seeking. With a little luck and a hefty amount of credits, I can arrange to acquire them for you.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day02_b_end_2: Thank you Ekekko. I'm sure we can find something in our cargo hold to exchange for credits.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day02_c_end_1: Excellent news, Commander! We managed to acquire much of Gideon's list in the transaction. Only a few parts remain.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day02_c_end_2: I was able to haggle additional information. One of the parts you're seeking has cultural significance to the Yaot. A fleet under the command of Zaque Guahai is looking for it now. Good luck!
* dia_anniversary_2023_day03_a_end_1: Commander! We recovered Yaot communication from the transmission logs of one of the downed ships.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day03_a_end_2: ...and continue scouring the region! Finding the Stambha has utmost priority. You will locate that reconnaissance disk, or there will be...
* dia_anniversary_2023_day03_a_end_3: Interesting. Reconnaissance disks are usually part of a ship's integral data box. If we collect salvage from hostiles in the area, we might be able to find this item first.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day03_b_end_1: We're in luck, we've recovered the reconnaissance disk Guahai is seeking. Navigation has the location of this Stambha. Hopefully it's the part Gideon is looking for...
* dia_anniversary_2023_day03_c_end_1: We have found the artifact and transferred it to the laboratory. Commander, the Yaot must know we have it, incoming transmission from Guahai.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day03_c_end_2: Your blaspheme against the Makers will not be forgotten, Hiigarans! The Stambha is not supposed to be in your hands! Your transgression will be remembered.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day03_c_end_3: It seems odd that the Yaot attach so much significance to a deep-space antenna. But then, our own people believed Sajuuk was a deity before finding the ship bearing the name.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day04_a_end_1: We have scanned the sector successfully, but discovered nothing of significance. Gideon, what are we looking for?
* dia_anniversary_2023_day04_a_end_2: Commander, in order to use the antenna we must find a specific piece of Progenitor equipment to match it as a receiver. An adapter also must be build to connect them.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day04_b_end_1: Resources received and processed. We should focus our efforts on finding the receiver component, but I have come up with no leads yet.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day04_b_end_2: Well and met, friend. I have heard vague rumors that an object of the given description is in possession of a powerful outlaw. I suggest stirring up the local underworld.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day04_c_end_1: Commander, many criminals have heard stories about the object in question. It is rumored to be stolen in a legendary heist from a Tanoch temple.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day04_c_end_2: The Tanoch? I'm afraid I don't have many contacts with the Empire. But didn't you make friends with one of their commanders?
* dia_anniversary_2023_day05_a_end_1: Commander, we have succeeded in opening a communication channel to Tepin Papan. Sending a request for assistance now.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day05_a_end_2: Greeting, Commander. It has been too long. The information you seek is rather difficult to obtain, but for a few favors, I might be able to take the risk on your behalf.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day05_b_end_1: Thank you for your help. We call the artifact you seek the Chintamani. It was indeed stolen recently. If you're willing to provide some more assistance, I can send you the report.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day05_b_end_2: We appreciate the help, Commander. We stand ready to assist you.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day05_c_end_1: The Empire is most satisfied with your work. I am sending you the report now. We suspect a Cangacian pirate was responsible for the theft. Good luck tracking him down.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day05_c_end_2: Thank you, Commander. We will pass on the reports to Lazarus Base to be processed.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day06_a_end_1: Commander, I formulated a new training program for the crew that will man the device once it's constructed. We should begin practice immediately.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day06_b_end_1: Your officer’s flexibility and adaptability is to be commended. What remains to be seen is combined integration between officers, crew, and ship.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day06_b_end_2: Commander, the training program teaches the crew to operate a hyperspace gate. Are we... trying to go home?
* dia_anniversary_2023_day06_c_end_1: Commander, we're receiving a coded transmission from a Yaot source. It's Guahai.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day06_c_end_2: Your theft of the Stambha remains inexcusable, Hiigarans. However, I am willing to pardon this offense if you follow my orders
* dia_anniversary_2023_day07_a_end_1: You are wise to follow my command, outsider. We will transmit specific alloy recipes for your refinery. Make sure your foundry masters adhere to them precisely!
* dia_anniversary_2023_day07_a_end_2: Commander, Guahai plays all tough, but he seems worried. He must need us to reinforce his fleet out here.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day07_b_end_1: The alloys you provided were crude, but acceptable. I am instructing my fleet’s engineers to send you specifications for parts we require. If you do this, I might consider your slight expunged.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day07_b_end_2: Guahai's fleet must be in dire need of repairs, Commander. We might get off the hook easily this time.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day07_c_end_1: Hiigarans, our business has concluded, your sin is hereby absolved. Be wary of crossing our paths in the future. Repeated offenses will not be forgiven.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day07_c_end_2: Our altercation with the Yaot is resolved for now. We should resume our quest to locate the last component for Gideon's device.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day08_a_end_1: Commander, we found the intel we need. The Fleet of Rams indeed have the artifact we seek. It is in the possession of Catequil, one of their Lieutenants.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day08_a_end_2: Outstanding. Commander, please retrieve the component as soon as possible. I can't wait to finalize the construction of the Progenitor Negotiator.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day08_b_end_1: Commander, we have an incoming transmission. It's a Cangacian frequency.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day08_b_end_2: I know what you are trying to do, Hiigarans. Obtaining this treasure has gained me great fame among my people. I will not hand it over to you willingly!
* dia_anniversary_2023_day08_c_end_1: Commander, we retrieved the stolen Progenitor artifact from Catequil and transferred it to the laboratory.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day08_c_end_2: Finally! This receiver perfectly matches the antenna. I will see to the completion of the Progenitor Negotiator at once. This device will shake the history of Nimbus.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day09_a_end_1: Your officer has been trained to use the new device I have engineered. For security reasons, I cannot specify what it does until we reach the special operation area.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day09_a_end_2: Commander, chatter among the crew indicates Gideon's device will communicate to a hyperspace gate. I just hope we won't have another gate disaster like when we entered Nimbus.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day09_b_end_1: Excellent, the freighter now has the parts needed for the special operation. Next, we must perform one final systems check so all can be ready.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day09_b_end_2: If this special operation is what I think it is, I can't help but think of how we got into all of this in the first place. Admiral Enoch's final command of returning home always felt impossible to complete.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day09_c_end_1: Commander, all forces are ready for the special operation.
* dia_anniversary_2023_day09_c_end_2: Excellent. You have done well, Commander. Very soon we will embark on the most important operation of our careers. All our efforts will pay off, I promise!
* dia_anniversary_2023_day10_a_end_1: Commander… we came across this at the gate. It’s a log transmission from Admiral Enoch. I’ve sent it to your private mail to review on your own.
* dia_halloween_2023_day01_end_1: This Progenitor behavior is unlike anything we’ve seen before. They’re actively attacking now, they’ve only been passive before.
* dia_halloween_2023_day01_end_2: Everything started with the corrupted Keeper at the gate. The last time Progenitor devices behaved like this was many thousands of years ago... at the close of the Progenitor Empire. History must not repeat!
* dia_halloween_2023_day02_end_1: We have delivered the raw material to the refineries in need, Commander. The defenses are strong for now, but they won't hold off the Progenitor attacks forever.
* dia_halloween_2023_day02_end_2: We triggered this incursion... It is our responsibility to find a way to stop it. We should collect data and begin research immediately
* dia_halloween_2023_day03_end_1: Commander, what we have gathered indicates the active Progenitors being controlled by a malignant frequency. It must come from the corrupted Keeper.
* dia_halloween_2023_day03_end_2: So we can put an end to the attacks by taking out the errant Keeper? But at the gate we couldn't even harm it...
* dia_halloween_2023_day04_end_1: We delivered the rare material to support the defense forces. Most garrisons are still holding strong, but the continual assaults are starting to weaken many sectors.
* dia_halloween_2023_day04_end_2: We must hasten our search for the errant Keeper. I might be able to triangulate its location, but first I need to decrypt the malignant command frequency.
* dia_halloween_2023_day05_end_1: I analyzed the command frequency. I don't understand... It's absurdly powerful. I suspect another Progenitor technology must be channeling energy to the Keeper.
* dia_halloween_2023_day05_end_2: Something else is energizing the corrupted Keeper? Perhaps destroying this source will neutralize its strange regenerative powers.
* dia_halloween_2023_day06_end_1: We provided the parts to replenish the defense forces. Their resolve is still strong, but at this rate of attrition, many systems won't be able to hold out much longer.
* dia_halloween_2023_day06_end_2: Commander, I fully decrypt the malignant command frequency. If we collect components from receiving Progenitor vessels I can start to triangulate the errant Keeper's location.
* dia_halloween_2023_day07_end_1: Commander, I finally found the source of the errant Keeper's signal. It is coming from a system in Cangacian space.
* dia_halloween_2023_day07_end_2: Excellent. Knowing these pirates, we'll have to arrange safe travel. We can't have anybody messing up our operation again. The fate of the galaxy hinges on this mission.
* dia_halloween_2023_day08_end_1: Officer training completed. We are as prepared as possible for confronting the errant Keeper and whatever technology is charging it with energy.
* dia_halloween_2023_day08_end_2: Commander, as this mission is of the utmost importance, I advise you to perform one last fleet wide ready-check.
* dia_halloween_2023_day09_end_1: Commander, all systems are ready for our critical mission. Gideon has provided us with the exact location of the Keeper's signal. We are ready.
* dia_halloween_2023_day09_end_2: Greetings, friend. It came to my attention that you need to negotiate a non-aggression agreement with the Cangacians. I'll see what my contacts can do.
* dia_halloween_2023_day10_end_1: My contacts have reached an agreement with the Cangacian warlords. They'll stay out of your way. I trust in your abilities to end this scourge. It has been egregious for everybody's business.
* dia_halloween_2023_day10_end_2: I've loaded the coordinates into the navigation system, Commander. We're ready. Let's end this Progenitor incursion once and for all.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day01_end_1: Greetings, Commander. I am Toci Citalicue, and I will act as liaison between you and my people, the Chicuat. I cannot thank you enough for your aid in this troubled time.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day01_end_2: It is our pleasure to help wherever we can. Lazarus offers assistance to all friendly factions still recovering from the recent Progenitor assaults.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day02_end_1: We’ve been able to restore critical machinery which will help us stabilize our industry. Thank you, it wouldn’t be possible without your assistance.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day02_end_2: Commander, I'm wondering why the Empire isn't helping the Chicuat. It seems the Tanoch have abandoned these people to their fate.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day03_end_1: Commander, we found cargo belonging to the Chicuat. Foodstuffs, basic machinery, textiles… not the valuable loot you'd expect.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day03_end_2: My people have suffered many raids on basic infrastructure lately. Whoever is behind these attacks is trying to destabilize us even further. This madness is inhumane!
* dia_tanwin_2023_day04_end_1: We have a deal! My friends among the Iyatequa have agreed to open up new shipping lanes to the Chicuat and supply basic goods.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day04_end_2: I'm deeply thankful for your support. This trade will surely allieviate some suffering among my people. I just hope we can put a stop to the raids soon.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day06_end_1: Greetings Commander. I'm pleased to hear you've been assisting my kinsmen, the Chicuat. I'm surprised you suspect the Tecuban behind these attacks, but I'm sending what information I have.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day06_end_2: I'm surprised you know Tepin Papan. Though many Tanoch hold my people with destain, every Chicuat is proud to serve in the Empire. I'm relieved to know we have his assistance.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day06_end_3: We met Tepin Papan in the Empty Quarter shortly after we arrived in Nimbus. Lazarus Base will process his information on the Tecuban.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day07_end_1: Commander, we found communications data among the wreckages that contains Heyoka's name. He must be involved with the local criminal network.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day07_end_2: I'm astounded the Tecuban would fall in with criminals. They may be destitute as we are, but even they would not normally raise a fist against other Tanoch.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day08_end_1: Commander, we retrieved more communications data between the criminals and Heyoka. We were able to trace his last location to a system called Acatla.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day08_end_2: Acatla? How can this be? That is well within Chicuat borders. Commander, I implore you, please investigate immediately!
* dia_tanwin_2023_day09_end_1: Hiigaran combat power is impressive, Commander. The Chicuat have always suffered persecution within the Empire. It feels very good to have a powerful ally for once.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day09_end_2: We understand the desperation. Only a century ago, we were just six hundred thousand exiles fighting an interstellar empire to retake our lost homeworld. We stand by your side in this conflict.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day11_end_1: It has been rumored the Vaygr are sheltering in Tecuban space. I will learn what I can, but these Vaygr have the patrongae of the Emperor. It will be difficult.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day11_end_2: The Vaygr are friends of the Emperor? Perhaps this is why the Empire is turning a deaf ear to our current plight. We may be hated, but never has the Empire ignored us as they have in this time.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day12_end_1: Commander, we are not finding any hard evidence of the Vaygr's activity around these systems. We're only picking up whispered rumors among the locals.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day12_end_2: The people have been through a lot lately. They're scared and uncertain. We'll need to gain their trust if we want to get someone to talk.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day13_end_1: Commander, our plan to gain the trust of the local people has worked. Our best lead comes from a nearby outpost.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day13_end_2: That is great news. They claim to have information that could match our description of the Vaygr. But they want us to help them with something before they hand it over.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day14_end_1: Commander, we received the information from the locals. It seems someone overheard a frigate crew boasting about working for powerful outsiders. This could be the Vaygr!
* dia_tanwin_2023_day14_end_2: I'm glad we could do something for the local people. Let's hunt down the Vaygr now and find out what they are scheming with the Tecuban!
* dia_tanwin_2023_day15_end_1: Commander, onboard one of these vessels we found communications data with a Vaygr frequency. This is the lead we've been waiting for.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day15_end_2: It's disturbing how many here are drawn to Vaygr promises of power, though I am not surprised. The Tecuban have even less than we do, and have more to gain from such an alliance.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day17_end_1: Commander, I've expended every avenue to gather more information. To probe further would risk my position, and I cannot help my people if I'm dismissed from my post. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day17_end_2: Even our allies in the Empire can no longer help us. What does Jochik have to gain through brutalizing my people? What does he want?
* dia_tanwin_2023_day17_end_3: My friends, if the answer can't be aquired through proper channels we should turn to the local markets. Let the power of coin open the door between you and the answer you seek.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day18_end_1: It's a deal, friends! A reputable source claims to have spoken to Jochik himself. He's seeking a very specific relic from the Makers, though I did not catch it's specifics.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day18_end_2: My people have hidden many objects of the Makers we retain for study and safekeeping. Jochik delivers pain, suffering, and ruin to my people all to attain an object of the Makers? Monster!
* dia_tanwin_2023_day19_end_1: Commander, we found a lot of data logs concerning Progenitor objects on these ships. We'll need to process them quickly. I'm sending them to the lab now.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day19_end_2: At your service, Commander. What a fascinating quantity of data. I'll do my best to come up with answers as soon as possible.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day20_end_1: Commander, the Tecuban raiders are well armed and confident. Heyoka and Jochik must be coordinating closely for this operation.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day20_end_2: All of this carngae for the greed of one and the ambition of the other! We must stop them, my people cannot withstand their assault for much longer!
* dia_tanwin_2023_day21_end_1: Thanks for your assistance, Commander. With the provided information, I was able to pinpoint the particular object in question. Jochik is seeking a very rare object the Tanoch call a Baetyl.
* dia_tanwin_2023_day21_end_2: Curse the Vaygr! They're after the Baetyl? It's placed at the Tlapallan Academy. It's one of our most populated learning centers! We must inform the Elders immediately!
* dia_yaospr_2024_day01_end_1: Hello, good friend! After some prying, I've learned Cangacian pirates have been hired by my fellows to raid some Yaot Pilgrims entering the area. What more, I cannot say.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day01_end_2: Yaot pilgrims in the Empty Quarter? Commander, this might be of interest to Hiigaran security. We should find out more about what's going on.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day02_end_1: Greetings, friend! My fellow tradesmen, of course, say nothing to me about their plans. But plenty of Cangacian marauders were eager to boast of their exploits.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day02_end_2: Commander, the pirates believe there is valuable treasure on the Yaot pilgrim ships. But for now they were only able to capture basic civilian goods.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day03_end_1: Commander, we can't find any traces of the Yaot pilgrimage. The area is swarming with pirates. They must know something we don't.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day04_end_1: Commander, some of the containers we've recovered have casualties. Many were deceased, but we also recovered survivors in critical condition.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day04_end_2: This is abhorrent... these can only be Yaot civilians! I am ordering them taken to medical away.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day05_end_1: Commander, we talked to the Yaot survivors. They were indeed part of the pilgrimage. They gave us their normal comm frequency, so we can contact the formation leader directly.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day05_end_2: A warm blessing to you, Hiigarans. I am Chocoan Coatl, Envoy of the Yaot Federation and Shepard of this Conjunction. I thank you for saving the lives of my fellow pilgrims.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day05_end_3: Greetings Envoy Coatl. We greet you on behalf of the Hiigaran colonies in this area. Your pilgrimage has caused an uprising of pirate activity here. Our authorities are worried about the security situation.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day05_end_4: We are but simple Pilgrims Commander, bound by our faith to visit conjunctions seen in our sky. Until now we had no need for escort, for none took an interest in our mission. This seems to have changed without reason.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day05_end_5: Commander, we can't leave these civilians defenseless against the pirates. It's unethical to stand by and allow it, we must help them.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day06_end_1: Blessings, Hiigarans. You have my thanks for these parts for our vessels. I am seeing to their distribution now.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day06_end_2: Commander, as requested we have tracked the delivery of the provided parts. It seems like some ships are clearly being prioritized over others.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day06_end_3: Interesting. Could these be the treasure ships the pirates were talking about? We need to find out more.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day07_end_1: Commander, we have a direct communication from the Cangacian pirates.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day07_end_2: You continue to meddle in affairs that are none of your business! I will have my treasure, and you will stop foiling my plans!
* dia_yaospr_2024_day07_end_3: Treasure? What treasure could be aboard these civilian ships? Have you no conscience terrorizing the innocent?
* dia_yaospr_2024_day07_end_4: Innocent? You Hiigarans are so naive with your trust it's offensive. If you stand in my way again, I will crush you along with these charlatans you defend!
* dia_yaospr_2024_day08_end_1: You gift us with your compassion, commander. Most would not go out of their way to defend a stranger.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day08_end_2: We Hiigarans were once nearly defenseless refugees ourselves. But what is this pilgrimage, what drives you?
* dia_yaospr_2024_day08_end_3: Our people have made these voyages for centuries. Our history tells us great events coincide with the conjunctions, which must be witnessed. Some of them tell us of the presence of the Makers among us still.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day08_end_4: This is fascinating... but I don't understand why your group would be targeted. Do you carry something special when observing the conjunction? An artifact of some kind?
* dia_yaospr_2024_day08_end_5: I'm afraid details such as these... must remain unspoken for now. I have much work to do, coordinating with the Elders. We will speak again.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day09_end_1: Hiigaran commander, we have received your request for further information. The Yaot Federation cannot comment on the pilgrimages of the conjunctions. This is strictly a civilian affair, and outside the official business of the Federation. Good day.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day09_end_2: That seemed unusually terse. We might need to think outside the box and find our other contacts for further information.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day10_end_1: Hello Commander! Thank you for the artifact, this will buy the information you seek. You're looking for more information on these conjunction pilgrimages?
* dia_yaospr_2024_day10_end_2: Yes. We're protecting the civilian pilgrims on their travels. Many believe some sort of treasure among their ships. We suspect some kind of involvement from the Yaot Elders.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day10_end_3: Interesting. Our intelligence concurs with your assessment. We have also suspected the Yaot have some other purpose behind these pilgrimages, something that has direct oversight from their council of Elders.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day10_end_4: Could this be some secret agenda by their leadership? Are they searching for something? Searching for treasures?
* dia_yaospr_2024_day10_end_5: The only other thing I can tell you is that our scouts detected ruins of the Makers there previously. What they do with them, we don't know. Good hunting!
* dia_yaospr_2024_day11_end_1: Commander, we've picked up a classified investigation report on the Yaot pilgrimage from one of the hostile vessels. Decryption process initiated.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day11_end_2: Most interesting. This is a detailed report on the procedure of the pilgrim's convoy at astral conjunction events. I want this evaluated as quickly as possible!
* dia_yaospr_2024_day12_end_1: Commander, we've collected ore from the asteroids near the astral conjunction site. The material is transferred into the laboratory to be examined.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day12_end_2: Commander, I have been monitoring the situation and I will assist in the examination. If there is anything here involving the Progenitors, I will find it.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day13_end_1: Blessings upon you, Commander. My people wish to convey their deepest thanks for your assistance. We are ready to engage the conjunction event in Ze Tavaan. May the Makers be with us.
* dia_yaospr_2024_day13_end_2: Envoy Coatl, this is Cangacian territory. It is almost certain the Cancagians will be waiting there in ambush. Is this event really so important to your people's faith that it's worth risking their lives?
* dia_yaospr_2024_day13_end_3: The decision... is not mine to make. We are guided by the wisdom of the Elders. But should you wish to provide escort, the people would be relieved to know we are under your protection.
* dia_amasum_2024_day01_end_1: Donating these parts has granted us a lot of goodwill from the local Amassari. At least we've managed to convince them we're not the Kiithless.
* dia_amasum_2024_day02_end_1: Most of what we've found isn't Progenitor... but Hagthar. Artifacts we've brought aboard date to the time of the Amassari's ancestors.
* dia_amasum_2024_day02_end_2: This must be what the Kiithless are doing here: Attacking the Amassari to steal relics belonging to the Amassari's forebears. We need to put a stop to it.
* dia_amasum_2024_day03_end_1: Hiigarans! I am Jothru Omassi. The Sadosar Amassari have chosen me to be an envoy to you during your stay here. I request permission to board and share my knowledge.
* dia_amasum_2024_day03_end_2: An Amassari guide could be useful if we're spending more time here. I've already assigned lodgings for him and he's being directed to medical for an examination now.
* dia_amasum_2024_day04_end_1: Your people have been most helpful to us in ways other Amassari are not. Many fear what the outsiders could bring to us, but there are many who celebrate your presence also.
* dia_amasum_2024_day05_end_1: It's going to be a long and intense operation in order to find these things. I feel better having the ship ready for this expedition.
* dia_amasum_2024_day06_end_1: The Hagthar pretty thoroughly blew their technology into dust during their ancient war. There's not much left to go on. What we found might have more cultural significance than technical...
* dia_amasum_2024_day07_end_1: Hiigarans that don't originate from one of the original Kiith are not only iconoclasts, but they employ some radical strategies. It was useful in our war against the Vaygr, but it's coming at a cost now.
* dia_amasum_2024_day08_end_1: These leads also brought us closer to some Hagthar technological patches. Engineering has pulled up some debris we happened to pass and thinks there might be something important we can deduce from it.
* dia_amasum_2024_day09_end_1: One of the important lessons taught in the fleet academy is to make sure resources are plentiful. There's no worse place than being caught without any RUs to spend when we need it.
* dia_amasum_2024_day10_end_1: The Sulasu family are one of the only Nacarid Amassari open to accepting bribes from outsiders. I assue you, they were just as pleased to accept your help as well as your target assignment list.
* dia_amasum_2024_day11_end_1: We're just in time. New intelligence points to the Kiithless restructuring their supplies in the region in order to regain their footing. If we hit them now, we might be able to break their resolve in the Hather plains.
* dia_amasum_2024_day12_end_1: Well done, but the Kiithless aren't done yet. We received word that mobile assets pulled out just before our strikes. They're planning something with their saved assets.
* dia_amasum_2024_day13_end_1: We're stocked and ready for whatever the Kiithless have in store for us.
* dia_amasum_2024_day14_end_1: Intelligence suggests the Kiithless were attempting to piece together a Hagthar navigational computer, and they've deduced they need a final piece.
* dia_amasum_2024_day14_end_2: They're after Thassin's Needle. Only three have ever been found. To my people, they represent a better future that could be.
* dia_amasum_2024_day14_end_3: We must protect this at all costs.
* dia_amasum_2024_day15_end_1: That was the last, desperate reach of the Kiithless. They'll need to regroup for a while before they can challenge the Amassari again.
* dia_amasum_2024_day15_end_2: It is a thing to raise a hand in defense of another Amassari, but another to respect our herritage. I wish to join your crew commander, I have many talents to offer beyond Amassari space.
