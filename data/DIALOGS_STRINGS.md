### Joanna
A hiigaran settlement? We should <color=#FBB03F>visit this Lazarus Station</color>. With luck, other missing expeditions to this galaxy made it there.

## QM_T0_INTROSTATION_END
### Ekekko
Greetings commander, I am Ekekko, a... merchant of the Iyatequa. I would like to seek passage aboard your vessel. In exchange for this transport, I can be your bargain hunter and local guide to this region. I take up little room, and in exchange I can open doors for you that would be closed otherwise.

### Joanna
Commander, the Iyatequa traders have a lot of local contacts in the vicinity. Access to what they know might be useful in the future. I’ve reviewed his proposal and it’s little effort to allow him and his cargo passage onboard. Security has already vetted his entry.

### Ekekko
Well and met Commander, I am pleased to make your acquaintance and share your voyage. Please come by to visit my on-ship store to <color=#FBB03F>collect your first payment</color> now. In the future you may return any time to collect your daily fee. You are my first customer.

## QM_T0_INTROMARKET_END
### Fleet Command
Commander, welcome to Lazarus Base. Our apologies for being unable to respond to your distress signal at Wiracoda gate.

### Fleet Command
We’ve had troubles from the local pirates. Your arrival has also agitated the Progenitor defenders in the region for reasons unknown.

### Fleet Command
We would like to welcome you aboard to bring you up to speed about the situation here in the Nimbus galaxy, but we could use some help securing the local area.

### Joanna
Acknowledged, Lazarus base. Commander, first we should re-equip our forces and <color=#FBB03F>build an interceptor squadron</color>. Our forces were thinned in the battle.

## QM_T0_INTROFABRICATOR_END
### Joanna
Very good. We need to <color=#FBB03F>ready the new fighters inside our hangars</color>.

## QM_T0_INTROEQUIPSTRIKECRAFT_END
### Joanna
Now that our interceptors are ready, we can <color=#FBB03F>scan the system</color> for hostile signals.

## QM_T0_INTROSCANNING_END
### Joanna
We found something. Hostiles confirmed. <color=#FBB03F>Jump to the signal</color> to engage the enemies.

## QM_T0_INTROSIGNALS_0_END
### Joanna
All enemies destroyed in the vicinity. We should return to Lazarus base and check in with them.

## QM_T0_INTROSIGNALS_END
### Fleet Command
Thank you for the assist, Commander. We had a raid pass through here as well and our facilities are damaged. We’re asking local commanders to gather resources and supply material for our repairs. Once we’re repaired our port facilities can reopen to you.

### Fleet Command
Scouts have already identified this system as being rich in the resources we need. It would help us if you could <color=#FBB03F>mine some ores</color> here and return them to us.

## QM_T0_V2_INTROSCANNING_0_END
### Joanna
We've detected a hostile signature within the system. We need to <color=#FBB03F>analyze the signal</color> to gather more information.

## QM_T0_V2_INTROSCANNING_END
### Joanna
Analysis of the signature completed. The location and additional information is tracked in our computers. <color=#FBB03F>Jump to the signal</color> to engage the enemies.

## QM_T0_V2_INTROSIGNALS_0_END
### Joanna
All enemies destroyed in the vicinity. We should return to Lazarus base and check in with them.

## QM_T0_V2_INTROSIGNALS_END
### Fleet Command
Thank you for the assist, Commander. We had a raid pass through here as well and our facilities are damaged. We’re asking local commanders to gather resources and supply material for our repairs. Once we’re repaired our port facilities can reopen to you.

### Fleet Command
Scouts have already identified this system as being rich in the resources we need. It would help us if you could <color=#FBB03F>mine some ores</color> here and return them to us.

## QM_T0_INTROSCANBELTS_0_END
### Joanna
There are several potential mining sites, but the signatures are scattered. We'll we need to <color=#FBB03F>analyze the asteroid clusters</color> before we can initiate mining operations.

## QM_T0_INTROSCANBELTS_END
### Joanna
Commander, we have located several mineral-rich asteroids. We can now <color=#FBB03F>jump to the cluster and use our resource collector to mine ores.</color>

## QM_T0_INTROMINING_END
### Joanna
That's it, we now should have enough ore. We should return and <color=#FBB03F>deliver the minerals to Lazarus Station</color>.

## QM_T0_SUPPORT_END
### Fleet Command
Resources received Commander, thank you. We have aboard Gideon S’jet, renowned Progenitor Expert and survivor of the original Caral expedition. He wishes to speak with you.

### Gideon S'jet
Commander, I am Gideon S’jet. I helped design the Progenitor Communicator you have aboard your vessel. I must assist your mission to explore Progenitor sites.

### Joanna
Gideon was the foremost expert in Progenitor sciences after Karan when he disappeared with the Caral expedition. His knowledge would be invaluable. We should <color=#FBB03F>assign Gideon S'jet to the bridge</color>.

## QM_T0_INTROBRIDGE_END
### Fleet Command
While assigned to the bridge, Gideon grants your flagship another combat skill, which can be activated during battle.

### Fleet Command
Skills require energy to activate. While it will regenerate over time, you cannot activate any skills if your energy reserves are depleted. Choose wisely when and which skills to use.

### Gideon S'jet
Thank you commander. I shall relocate myself and my team to your vessel. I advise you to build up your fleet, Progenitor ruins are not to be taken lightly.

### Joanna
Dangerous is an understatement. Lazarus Base has offered the use of their shipyards, we should take advantage of this and <color=#FBB03F>build an assault frigate</color>.

## QM_T0_INTROSHIPYARD_END
### Joanna
The shipyard construction has finished. We need to <color=#FBB03F>ready our new frigate using the Fleet Configuration</color>.

## QM_T0_INTROEQUIPESCORTS_END
### Gideon S'jet
Commander, I have studied the after-action report of Wiracoda Gate. Something has changed among the Progenitor ruins in this galaxy, but I require more data before I can begin a useful analysis.

### Gideon S'jet
I have colleagues in the local vicinity which may have more information than I have available. We should visit Baaekh S'jet first. I have sent the coordinates of her research lab to your navigation database.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_A_0_END
### Joanna
Commander, Baaekh S’jet is reported missing. She went on an expedition to the Saaret system and hasn't returned.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_A_1_END
### Joanna
There’s no sign of Baaekh. We should start scanning the area for her. Maybe she's located somewhere inside the extensive asteroid belt of this system.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_A_2_END
### Crew Member
Commander, this is Baaekh S’jet. I am being hunted by hostile craft. Please take care of them, I cannot help you until then.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_A_END
### Joanna
We have located the hostile forces that have Baaekh S'jet pinned down. We'll engage them at your order, Commander.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_B_0_END
### Crew Member
Thank you commander. I had no means of escape without your assistance. I can provide you the data you seek if you return me to the research station in Iniim.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_B_END
### Crew Member
Thank you for returning me safely. Here is your data. We found coordinates to a progenitor ruin which might be useful for you.

### Gideon S'jet
Thank you. Commander, I have sent the coordinates of the ruin into the navigation database.

## QM_T0_RELIC_0_END
### Joanna
Commander, we must scan this system to locate the relic's signature.

## QM_T0_RELIC_1_END
### Crew Member
Relic signature detected. Coordinates locked. We'll investigate on your command.

## QM_T0_RELIC_2_END
### Gideon S'jet
The relic has yielded some interesting information, but unfortunately no answers. I will send the coordinates to my second colleague into the navigation database.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_HYEAA_A_0_END
### Crew Member
Commander, Gideon has informed me you are seeking information. I am willing to help, but we are currently running low on resources. What do you say, you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours?

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_HYEAA_A_END
### Crew Member
Yes, this will do. I am transmitting my research data as we speak.

### Gideon S'jet
Commander, this looks very promising. With this data I have traced a progenitor command signal back to Toasiim. We should find a Progenitor Relic generating this signal there.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_HYEAA_B_0_END
### Crew Member
I see the rapid construction techniques have scantly improved in my absence, save for materials allocation and allotment. How little we’ve improved over even the past century.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_HYEAA_B_END
### Crew Member
Thank you commander. I am giving you my conclusions based on my studies here of Progenitor manufacturing. There are some techniques you may find useful for future modifications.

### Gideon S'jet
Commander, I have traced a progenitor command signal back to Toasiim. We should find a Progenitor Relic generating this signal there.

## QM_T0_JOLJA_0_END
### Gideon S'jet
The progenitor terminal must be somewhere in this system. We should perform some scans to find it.

## QM_T0_JOLJA_1_END
### Gideon S'jet
We're picking up the right signature. We're on the right track. I locked in the coordinates. We should go there and find it.

## QM_T0_JOLJA_END
### Fleet Command
Commander, your star is rising among our people, and we wish to know <color=#FBB03F>what Kiith you declare allegiance for</color>. Declaring for a Kiith will bring other survivors of that Kiith to your fleet, along with their gifts.

## QM_T0_PICKKIITH_END
### Fleet Command
Excellent. The old structures are still strong, but new systems are beginning to emerge. Maybe you want to join a clan as well.

### Joanna
Commander, while you are listed as the ship's captain, Admiral Enoch is still considered our commanding officer, which...

### Joanna
What I'm trying to say is that you should <color=#FBB03F>register your name</color> in the admiralty board computer. Then you will be officially recognized as our leading flag officer.

## QM_T0_PICKNAME_END
### Gideon S'jet
We have completed upgrades to the hyperspace module. With greater power we can overcome the strange gravity anomalies that litter this galaxy.

## QM_T3_GASMINING_0_END
### Joanna
Now that we have built a gas collector, we can send it into jovians to harvest useful gases.

### Joanna
To do so, simply move it into the outer atmospheric layer of a gas planet. It will start collection automatically.

### Joanna
But we need to be careful. Deeper layers will deal more <color=#FBB03F>damage</color> to our craft. Don't send it in too deep!

Your kind reside in the Empty Quarter. Coordinates to Lazarus, your capital, have been transmitted. Good fortune to you.

## STORY_GULFTALN_CONCLUSION_DIALOG
### Joanna
The mothership Lazarus has been missing since the first expeditions to Nimbus. The other survivors must have gathered there!

## STORY_RELIC_INTRO_DIALOG
### Joanna
The relic is up ahead, but there are other signals near it. <color=#FBB03F>Move closer to identify these unkown objects.</color>

## STORY_RELIC_COMBAT_DIALOG
### Joanna
It is a Progenitor patrol defending the relic. <color=#FBB03F>Destroy these ships!</color>

## STORY_RELIC_END_DIALOG
### Crew Member
Objective Retrieved. The Progenitor Relic has been processed and transferred to storage.

### Gideon S'jet
What a fascinating artifact. I will begin its examination immideately.

## STORY_JOLJA_INTROSEQUENCE_DIALOG
### Gideon S'jet
Based on my scans of this debris field, a functioning Progenitor computer terminal is here.

### Joanna
Hopefully we can learn why the Progenitor Communicator failed at Wiracoda gate.

## STORY_JOLJA_OPENSENSOR_DIALOG
### Crew Member
Commander, we should <color=#FBB03F>open the Sensor Manager</color> to get a tactical reading of our immediate surroundings.

## STORY_JOLJA_SIGNATURES_DIALOG
### Joanna
Multiple Progenitor signatures detected. Our fleet is not equipped to fight them all at once. We should <color=#FBB03F>avoid them</color> as best as we can.

## STORY_JOLJA_CLOSESENSOR_DIALOG
### Crew Member
Commander, remember that you can <color=#FBB03F>close the Sensor Manager</color> when you don't need it.

## STORY_JOLJA_TERMINALA_DIALOG
### Gideon S'jet
Sensors indicate this large debris fragment may contain the terminal. <color=#FBB03F>Close in to investigate</color>.

## STORY_JOLJA_TERMINALB_DIALOG
### Gideon S'jet
No Progenitor computer terminal was found, but sensors identified another strong signal further ahead.

## STORY_JOLJA_TERMINALTIMER_DIALOG
### Crew Member
Scanning the fragment now.

## STORY_JOLJA_WAVEA_DIALOG
### Gideon S'jet
The terminal is here. Progenitor defenses are activating to protect it. Do not let them interfere with our work!

## STORY_JOLJA_WAVEB_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander, more Progenitor drones are activating to attack us. We're at risk of being overwhelmed.

## STORY_JOLJA_ALLY_DIALOG
### Crew Member
Hyperspace signatures detected! A keeper? No... these ships are of unknown design. Incoming message.

### Tepin Papan
Unidentified ship, stand by, we are here to assist you. We will clear the errant maker drones.

## STORY_JOLJA_TEPIN_DIALOG
### Tepin Papan
I am Tepin Papan of the Tanoch Empire. Starship, what is your purpose in this dangerous area?

### Joanna
We have just arrived in this area of the galaxy. We seek more information about the Progenitors, those who made these ruins.

### Tepin Papan
Progenitors? Interesting. We know only one other who calls the Makers by this name.

### Tepin Papan
The Tanoch Emperor would be most interested to meet you. You should <color=#FBB03F>pay visit to Tanochet</color>, our capital. Transmitting coordinates. Farewell!

## STORY_JOLJA_RESOLUTION_DIALOG
### Gideon S'jet
Commander, the terminal was damaged in combat. We should accept the Tanoch's invitation and see what they can tell us.

## S_SHAKEDOWN_INTRO_1_DIALOG
### Fleet Command
Welcome to Tarsus Yard Commander. The combat area is prepared and stands ready.

## S_SHAKEDOWN_INTRO_2_DIALOG
### Fleet Command
Decommissioned ships have been provided for target practice. They are coded as enemies.

### Fleet Command
Remember that only strike craft are allowed to be utilized in this test.

## S_SHAKEDOWN_INTRO_3_DIALOG
### Joanna
Thank you Tarsus Command. Flagship and escort are on standby and deactivated until further instructions.

## S_SHAKEDOWN_TUT_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander, Plasma Bombers are very effective against armored tagets. Use them to attack the Decommissioned Frigates.

### Joanna
Interceptors are perfect to attack other strike craft. You should always order them to attack unarmored targets.

## S_SHAKEDOWN_TUT_2_DIALOG
### Fleet Command
Commander, trial timer is set for 3 minutes. Begin your combat trial on this mark.

## S_SHAKEDOWN_DESTROY_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Combat Trial successful. All targets destroyed.

## S_SHAKEDOWN_WAVE_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander... Cangacian hyperspace signatures detected. It looks like we've drawn some attention.

### Joanna
All ships reactivated. Remember to utilize our strike craft as effectively as possible!

## S_SHAKEDOWN_FIN_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
The area is secure. Seems like their mistake was raiding a live-fire exercise area.

## S_SHAKEDOWN_FAIL_1_DIALOG
### Fleet Command
Commander, your unit has failed the Combat Trial. We will rest out equipment and you can return to try again.

## S_MEROPIS_INTRO_1_DIALOG
### Iyatequa Trader
Hiigarans! Welcome to Meropis station. Your timing is most fortunate, we are about to come under attack from Cangacian Pirates.

### Iyatequa Trader
They are attempting to disable our hyperspace transmitters. Please repel the attackers!

## S_MEROPIS_GROUP_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander, there are two hyperspace transmitters that need to be defended simultaneously. We must split our fleet into <color=#FBB03F>groups</color>.

## S_MEROPIS_GROUP_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
Great. Assign more units to the group.

## S_MEROPIS_GROUP_3_DIALOG
### Joanna
Send units to both Hyperspace Transmitters!

## S_MEROPIS_POSITION_1_DIALOG
### Iyatequa Trader
Just in time. Here they come!

## S_MEROPIS_FINISH_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
We did it. All hostiles eliminated.

### Iyatequa Trader
Many thanks to you Hiigarans for the timely defense. Our communications traffic through this node is maintained.

## S_MEROPIS_FAIL_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander, one of the transmitters was destroyed. We have failed.

## S_POOL_INTRO_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Hyperspace jump successful, we’ve arrived at the Pool. The area is littered with pirate loot, but also guarded by defensive platforms.

## S_POOL_TUTRANGE_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Sensors have determined these kinetic batteries have inferior tracking equipment. Their range is limited as a result.

### Joanna
If we attack them from a distance we can prevent damage to the fleet. Weapon ranges are marked in the sensor manager. <color=#FBB03F>Attack from a distance!</color>

## S_POOL_TUTFALLOFF_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
These platforms are of a different type, they are armed with poor quality missiles.

### Joanna
Sensors indicate they can attack at long range, but their accuracy drops off at a distance. We stand a minimal chance of being hit at stand-off range.

## S_POOL_CLOSEKIN_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Don’t get too close to the kinetic batteries. <color=#FBB03F>Stay out of range</color> to avoid being targeted.

## S_POOL_CLOSEMIS_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Avoid getting too close to the missile platforms, at close range they can inflict heavy damage. Strike craft are most vulnerable to direct hits.

## S_POOL_DESTROY_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
The area is cleared of platforms. You should familiarize yourself with weapons ranges and accuracy profiles to be prepared against anything we face in the future.

### Joanna
Commander, sensors report contacts emerging from hyperspace nearby. It’s too soon to be a friendly salvage party.

## S_POOL_PIRATES_1_DIALOG
### Cangacian Commander
Thieves! Nobody steals from us bandits! Prepare to die!

## S_POOL_FINISH_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
The area seems secure. If there was a bigger garrison they would have shown up by now. We can signal the Iyatequa to collect their salvage.

## STORY-03-01_START_DIALOG
### Tepin Papan
Welcome to Tanochet. Our Emperor is eager to meet you. Proceed to our orbital station and prepare for docking.

## STORY-03-01_YAOTSPAWN_DIALOG
### Tepin Papan
Alert! Yaot raiders detected! All ships prepare for intercept!

## STORY-03-01_TORPEDO1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander, torpedoes emerging from hyperspace! The Yaot appear to be targeting civilian traffic, possibly to disrupt the defenses.

### Joanna
The Tanoch fleet appears to be concentrating their defenses around the stations. We need to intercept those torpedoes or hundreds may die.

## STORY-03-01_TORPEDO2_DIALOG
### Joanna
Another hyperspace torpedo has emerged on the far side of sensor range. We must intercept it!

## STORY-03-01_TORPEDO3_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander, two torpedoes have emerged from hyperspace! They're both aiming for the civilian stations!

## STORY-03-01_ATTACKOVER_DIALOG
### Tepin Papan
Starship, thank you for your assistance. Damage to the stations was minimal, and the People extend their thanks. You are welcome to dock, you have earned it.

## STORY-03-01_DIALOG_FINISH
### Tepin Papan
Approaching station. Initiating docking procedure. Our emperor is already awaiting you.

## STORY-03-01_DIALOG_FAILURE
### Joanna
Commander, one of the stations has suffered a direct hit! Casualty reports are coming through, it's not looking good.

### Joanna
The Yaot are retreating. Evidently this was a hit and run operation... but did they achieve their objective?

### Tepin Papan
Starship, we appreciate your assistance, but our emperor has more urgent matters to attend to now. Your visit will have to wait.

## STORY-03-02-V2_START_DIALOG
### Joanna
We have arrived at what the Tanoch call Star Totek.

### Joanna
Vaygr signal traffic points to this system. They're up to something here, stay alert.

## STORY-03-02-V2_MOVETOSTATION_DIALOG
### Joanna
Interesting.. Theres a Progenitor structure here. Function is unknown. Tanoch maps identify this as Temple Tonaati.

### Joanna
We should begin our investigation there. However, it seems the temple is heavily patrolled by the Tanoch temple forces. They probably won't admit us.

### Joanna
Their defenses are formidable, and we don't want to commit sacrilage by attacking a Holy Site.

### Joanna
Solar activity is significant beyond the station, It's too risky to travel there.

### Joanna
However, there are two debris field passages we can use to stay safe through the Solar radiation.

### Joanna
One is to the left, the other is to the right.

### Joanna
We cannot scan the debris fields from this distance, but it is a good guess there may be Progenitor devices active in this debris. Its still safer than turning the Temple's defenses against us.

## STORY-03-02-V2_CIVILSTATION_REACHED_DIALOG
### Joanna
Many ships are headed to the temple, likely carrying pilgrims to worship the star.

### Joanna
We've scanned Temple Tonaati. There are no Vaygr ships or transmissions here.

## STORY-03-02-V2_EXPLAINSTAR_DIALOG
### Joanna
This is interesting... the Temple has a built in field generator, creating a magnetic funnel.

### Joanna
Not only can we use it to get close to the star through hyperspace, but it will bring us to a specific destination. We won't know until we use it.

### Joanna
The Vaygr aren't here now, but they may have passed through this area recently.

## STORY-03-02-V2_YAOTSUDDENLY_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander, a large cluster of craft have just emerged from Hyperspace. It's... a Yaot attack force.

### Guahai
Attention, Tanoch Defenders. I am Guahai, Zaque of the Yaot Federation. Surrender yourselves, or be destroyed.

### Joanna
This is a civilian installation! The defenses here are too small to fend off an entire attack force!

### Guahai
Do not doubt that we will do what is necessary in the shadow of your holy place. Surrender! We are the stronger here!

## STORY-03-02-V2_YAOTATTACK_DIALOG
### Joanna
The Yaot fleet is too massive for us to even hope to stop. Even if we were to join forces with the temple defenders.

## STORY-03-02-V2_TEMPLE_KILLED_DIALOG
### Joanna
I... commander, the defenses have been destroyed by unknown means. They must have tremendous firepower at their disposal!

### Chaquen
I am Chaquen, a Commander in the Yaot Federation.

### Chaquen
Hiigarans, you are known to us. I say to you now: abandon these people. You are not involved in this war. Save yourselves. Leave before it is too late.

### Joanna
Commander, we can't sit by and leave these people to their fate. We must defend the installation.

## STORY-03-02-V2_BOSS_DIALOG
### Joanna
The Yaot are sending another probing force towards us. Prepare for contact!

## STORY-03-02-V2_FINISH_DIALOG
### Joanna
It seems the Yaot are pulling away from the area. Odd... a force-size like that, they should have destroyed us easily.

### Joanna
Commander... the field generator is disabled. The funnel is gone. The Tanoch must have destroyed it rather than let the Yaot gain possession of it.

### Joanna
The Yaot must know this also, they've left the area. However, we still have the travel vector and coordinates targeted by the funnel. That should be our next destination.

## STORY-03-02-V2_MISSIONFAIL_DIALOG
### Joanna
The station is gone... so many lives lost. We must escape before the Yaot finish us off as well!

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Hyperspace jump successful.

### Joanna
We are in orbit over what the Tanoch call Star Totek: Their Holy star.

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
Totek is highly unusual. Outside temperatures are only a fraction of what we would expect for a star of this size.

### Joanna
Though the star has central religious significance to the Tanoch, very little scientific data is publicly known about it.

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_3_DIALOG
### Joanna
Comms are still detecting significant Vaygr signal traffic in the area. They seem to be emanating from here.

### Joanna
We need to discover what the Vaygr are doing here, and get a better estimation of their forces.

### Joanna
The presence of a Progenitor debris ring is unusual, but we can use this to get closer to the signal point. Use the debris to shield our ships from the heat of the star.

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_4_DIALOG
### Joanna
Fleet Intelligence suggests this is the safest route through the debris to the target area.

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_5_DIALOG
### Joanna
There is an area where we can risk damage to flank the Vaygr, if they're there. They won't expect us coming from this vector.

## ST_STARTOTEK_DEBRI_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
We must navigate the debris. Although Totek is a colder star, direct exposure to the corona will damage our ships. The debris will shield us.

### Joanna
The heat is intense enough to rapidly destroy our strike craft, which lack the armor to survive the corona's intensity.

### Joanna
Recommend docking our strike craft and harvesters until we are in a safer area.

## ST_STARTOTEK_DEBRI_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
Warning! We are no longer shielded from the sun. The fleet is taking damage!

## ST_STARTOTEK_DEBRI_3_DIALOG
### Joanna
Initiating Emergency hyperspace! Commander, we have to clear the range of the sun and repair the fleet before we can continue.

## ST_STARTOTEK_SENTI_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Attack drones detected. Be careful maneuvering here, don't let the drones draw you out into the sun.

## ST_STARTOTEK_SENTI_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
If we go to the signal point from here, we'll be catching them by complete surprise. Do you wish to cross here?

## ST_STARTOTEK_SENTI_3_DIALOG
### Joanna
If we cross here to the signal point, we'll catch anyone out of position. Shall we cross here?

## ST_STARTOTEK_SENTI_4_DIALOG
### Joanna
More attack drones. Keep the fleet together Commander, don't let them draw us into the sunlight!

## ST_STARTOTEK_VAYGR_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
We're closing on the location of the Vaygr signal.

## ST_STARTOTEK_VAYGR_2_DIALOG
### Vaygr Commander
My lord, the Hiigarans are here.

### Jochik Kaan
Excellent, and very timely. They did not disappoint.

### Jochik Kaan
Hiigarans, I extend you a formal welcome to the Nimbus Galaxy.

### Jochik Kaan
Of course, I cannot let you interrupt my plans. Since I know it is already useless to ask for your surrender, instead, I'll bid you to die well.

### Jochik Kaan
Destroy them.

## ST_STARTOTEK_BATTLE_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
The Vaygr are attacking. We need to push past them to see what they are planning!

## ST_STARTOTEK_BATTLE_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
Vaygr reinforcements coming out of Hyperspace!

## ST_STARTOTEK_SALVA_1_DIALOG
### Vaygr Commander
The nodule is loaded and secured, my lord.

### Jochik Kaan
Excellent.

### Jochik Kaan
We are finished here, Hiigarans. I will depart now.

### Jochik Kaan
But I leave you with one bit of advice, and a warning.

### Jochik Kaan
Do not rest to your assumptions. All can change in an instant.

### Jochik Kaan
And you have much to learn about the extent of the Progenitor's Legacy.

### Jochik Kaan
Farewell.

## ST_STARTOTEK_SALVA_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
He's taunting us. This raises even more questions about what the Vaygr intend to do in Nimbus.

### Joanna
For now lets focus on surviving the moment!

## ST_STARTOTEK_SALVA_3_DIALOG
### Joanna
Based on sensor analysis, this object is a power transmission nodule. It collects energy from the star to beam to distant targets.

### Joanna
There are literally thousands of these arrays in orbit around Totek. It seems Jochik was salvaging a component from them... but we don't know what it is.

### Joanna
We won't find more answers here. We need to continue investigating local systems and inquire among the Tanoch.

## ST_FARSHORE_INTRO_DIALOG
### Joanna
We've arrived at the location of the Khar-Kalaad's distress signal.

### Joanna
I've marked the Khar-Kalaad's exact position on the Sensor's manager. We should investigate.

### Joanna
We have no response to outgoing signals, so either Vice Admiral Vashti is keeping a low profile, or it's a trap. Proceed with caution.

## ST_FARSHORE_ALLY_DIALOG
### Joanna
Sensors confirm, it's the Khar-Kalaad.

### Vashti
Greetings Commander, it has been a long time.

### Joanna
Vice Admiral! It's good to see you alive! We lost all contact after the battle at Wiracoda Gate.

### Vashti
We were forced to conduct major repairs after that battle. We maintained a low profile afterward, in order to avoid attracting attention.

### Vashti
By then you had already gotten the attention of the local powers. While you forged ahead we gathered more information about the Progenitors of this galaxy. This lead us here.

### Joanna
We've had dubious luck using it in the past. Are you sure it's wise to try it?

### Vashti
It's our best chance to access this data. Consider it an order from a superior officer of Task Force Ararat.

### Joanna
We could use that data, and the Vice Admiral is still technically our commander.

## ST_FARSHORE_START_DIALOG
### Joanna
In order to establish a connection we'll need to dock a resource controller with the Lighthouse. Target is designated.

## ST_FARSHORE_HODOR_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Our salvage team has docked with the Lighthouse. They're connecting with the Khar-Kalaad's team now.

### Vashti
Commander, we have incoming hyperspace signatures at distance.

### Tanoch Commander
Intruders, this site is holy. Surrender your vessels and prepare to be boarded.

### Joanna
These are Tanoch Temple guardians. We must have offended some Tanoch religious taboo by coming here.

## ST_FARSHORE_HODOR_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
Engineering, what's your status?

### Crew Member
Connection is being completed now, command. Cryptography is trying to input signal.

### Joanna
We don't have much time. Another wave is incoming.

## ST_FARSHORE_HODOR_3_DIALOG
### Crew Member
Commander, Cryptography reports there's no cartographic data here.

### Vashti
Are you certain?

### Crew Member
Yes Vice Admiral. We're continuing to investigate.

## ST_FARSHORE_HODOR_4_DIALOG
### Joanna
We can't take much more of this.

### Crew Member
Command, this tower is a navigational aid. It's used to cross the nearby unstable nebula to reach the other side.

### Joanna
A tightrope into the maelstrom?

## ST_FARSHORE_EYE_1_DIALOG
### Vashti
More ships are approaching through hyperspace. We cannot delay, any longer and we won't be able to escape safely.

### Crew Member
We're close to gaining navigational data to guide us to the other end of the bridge network. We need more time!

### Joanna
Commander... something... odd is happening right above us!

## ST_FARSHORE_EYE_2_DIALOG
### Vashti
What is that?

### Joanna
There's no corresponding craft of this type in our database on the Progenitors.

### Observer
(Unable to translate)

## ST_FARSHORE_EYE_3_DIALOG
### Vashti
The light house is projecting a massive quantum tunnel! Reading coordinates...

## ST_FARSHORE_ESC_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Our engines aren't powerful enough to pursue the Progenitor object.

## ST_FARSHORE_ESC_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
We have its destination vector. When we have a powerful enough engine, we can pursue.

## STORY-S2-01-LIGHTHOUSE_DIALOG_FAIL
### Joanna
Commander, the Khar-Kaalad has been hit! We must withdraw!

## STORY-S2-01-LIGHTHOUSE_DIALOG_FINISH
### Joanna
We have its destination vector. When we have a powerful enough engine, we can pursue.

## ST_FARSHORE_INSERTINTERACTABLE_1_DIALOG
### Gary
INSERT INTERACTABLE SYSTEM

## ST_ILIYIN_INTRO_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Hyperspace jump completed. Looks like the lighthouse guided us successfully through the maelstrom.

### Vashti
No sign of any recent activity here. This region of space is uncharted to everyone we've met so far in Nimbus.

## ST_ILIYIN_INTRO_2_DIALOG
### Vashti
This is amazing, no other empire we've encountered has been able to build into the Progenitor Ruins as we have.

## ST_ILIYIN_INVESTIGATION_1_DIALOG
### Vashti
These people might have information about the Progenitors we haven't collected yet. We must investigate.

## ST_ILIYIN_INVESTIGATION_2_DIALOG
### Vashti
Commander, my sensor officer has detected hyperspace signatures emerging at some distance. Be on alert, we're not alone here.

## ST_ILIYIN_AMASSARI_1_DIALOG
### Amassari
(Amassari language, no translation available).

### Joanna
Linguistics is trying to work on a translation database now.

## ST_ILIYIN_BREAKWATER_1_DIALOG
### Vashti
Until we can communicate we must stand our ground.

## ST_ILIYIN_BREAKWATER_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
More craft incoming. Their armor is stronger than any ship we've encountered in Nimbus. This will be tough.

## ST_ILIYIN_BREAKWATER_3_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander, translation is up. We have a workable dictionary to communicate with.

### Vashti
This is Vice Admiral Vashti, of the Hiigaran battlegroup Ararat. We mean you no hostility, please cease your attacks!

### Amassari
Outsiders are forbidden among the trees of our ancestors! Submit, or die!

### Joanna
So much for diplomacy. Let's get out of here!

### Joanna
Commander! I'm picking up a Hyperspace gravity well forming in the vicinity.

## ST_ILIYIN_ANCHORS_1_DIALOG
### Vashti
The Hyperspace Inhibitors are located here. They must be disabled if we have any hope of escape.

## ST_ILIYIN_ANCHORS_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
First Inhibitor destroyed.

## ST_ILIYIN_ANCHORS_3_DIALOG
### Joanna
Second Hyperspace Inhibitor Destroyed.

## ST_ILIYIN_ANCHORS_4_DIALOG
### Joanna
That's the last Inhibitor, we're clear to depart.

### Joanna
Command be advised, Progenitor attack drones are active in the area.

### Vashti
They don't appear to be reacting to anything specific, but they stand in our way.

## ST_ILIYIN_ANCHORS_5_DIALOG
### Joanna
Command be advised, Progenitor attack drones are active in the area.

## ST_ILIYIN_COUNTDOWN_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
That's the last Hyperspace Inhibitor, the effect will clear in a minute. Defend the fleet until then!

## ST_ILIYIN_PUSH_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
The effect will clear in a few minutes. Defend the fleet until then!

## ST_ILIYIN_PUSH_2_DIALOG
### Vashti
Prepare for hyperspace!

### Joanna
Commander! Mothership-class signature appearing above us!

## ST_ILIYIN_OBSERVER_1_DIALOG
### Observer

## ST_ILIYIN_OBSERVER_2_DIALOG
### Vashti
My God... what just happened?

### Amassari
Traveler, we are the family Alut of the Amassari. The Observer has blessed you, attacking you was our error.

### Vashti
What was that thing? Where was it going?

### Amassari
The Observer is a herald of change. It comes to us in times of great upheaval, we know nothing more beyond this.

### Amassari
Travel to Bright Temple, some distance inward. The Family Talot there will tell you more.

Commander, we have arrived at the Bright Temple.

## ST_BTEMPLE_INTRO_2_DIALOG
### Vashti
Hopefully the Talot, the Amassari family living here, can tell us more about the Observer.

## ST_BTEMPLE_APPRO_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
This site is holy to the Amassari. We should approach with caution.

## ST_BTEMPLE_CHALL_1_DIALOG
### Vashti
Amassari of Bright Temple, we are the Hiigarans. We-

### Amassari
Aliens! You return to pillage our temples and desecrate our lands! May our gods smite you for your barbarity!

## ST_BTEMPLE_CHALL_2_DIALOG
### Joanna
They've cut the communication link! We are under attack!

## ST_BTEMPLE_RETRE_1_DIALOG
### Vashti
Pull back and regroup. We cannot negotiate under these circumstances.

## ST_BTEMPLE_ESCAP_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
We should escape and regroup, but the Amassari have activated Hyperspace Inhibitors to pin us. We must destroy them!

## ST_BTEMPLE_CAVAL_1_DIALOG
### Vashti
Hyperspace Inhibitors destroyed. We can retreat at will. Wait... The temple is under attack from another force. They're... Hiigaran?

## ST_BTEMPLE_BLHGN_1_DIALOG
### Kidara
Finally cracked this chestnut! All teams, move in. We'll begin salvage operations as soon as we finish mopping up.

## ST_BTEMPLE_BLHGN_2_DIALOG

They're broken! A bounty for anyone who can sink a squatter's ship. Leave no survivors!

## ST_BTEMPLE_BLHGN_3_DIALOG
### Kidara
The Kiith? It would be you to appear and spoil my victory.

### Vashti
I should have known we would encounter the Kiithless eventually. They have nothing but disdain for us Kiith clans. Tread carefully.

## ST_BTEMPLE_FAIL_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
Commander, the Khar-Kaalad has been hit! We must withdraw!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_INTRO1
### Joanna
Hyperspace jump complete. This is Hataldan, capital of the ancient Hagthar Empire, the ancestors of the Amassari.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_INTRO2
### Vashti
The Observer is here. Tread carefully, the Amassari seem to be arranged in some sort of ritual.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_INTRO3
### Kidara
As if these barbarians are any threat to us. We are here for the Observer, what do we care if we offend them?

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_APPROACH
### Joanna
The Observer itself is sending us coordinates. I think it's an invitation to approach.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_INTERLUDE

The ancient roads are broken, only few remain standing between your world and ours. They are remembered in a place called-

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_ABDUCTION1
### Kidara
All units, close in and secure the objective. Target hyperspace coordinates for fallback position Delta, Aurex.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_ABDUCTION2
### Vashti
Vice Admiral Kidara, stop this! You're endangering us all!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_ABDUCTION3
### Kidara
That's not my problem, Vice Admiral. I'm sure you Kiithid will figure it out. Meanwhile, I have a job to do. Fleet, hyperspace in five!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPTUT
### Joanna
The Observer was the only thing keeping the Keepers from attacking. We can't let them destroy the Amassari!

### Vashti
Commander, my ship is equipped with an EMP weapon designed to disrupt the Keepers. We completed it after Wiracoda.

### Vashti
We can stun the Keepers for a short time and render them vulnerable. We only have 3 charges, make them count!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_FIGHT
### Vashti
The keepers are here. Avoid contact until the EMP is ready. First charge energizing now.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPFIRED_1
### Vashti
First EMP fired. The Keepers are stunned, it worked! Inflict as much damage as possible!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPFIRED_2
### Vashti
Second EMP fired. Keepers are shutting down. All ships engage!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPFIRED_3
### Vashti
Third EMP fired. This is our final chance to destroy the keepers, hold back nothing!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPOFF_1
### Vashti
The Keepers are showing signs of reactivation! Prepare for incoming fire until the second charge is energized.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPOFF_2
### Vashti
The Keepers are reactivating! Expect the attacks to resume any moment.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_FIGHTWON
### Joanna
The final keeper is destroyed, area cleared! We did it!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_CONCLUSION
### Amassari
Hiigarans, I am Elder Kotlan of the Lyad. Your bravery does not go amiss, but neither does the behavior of your ally. What are your intentions?

### Vashti
We were betrayed by one of our own. On our honor as exiles, we will free the Observer and punish its captor.

### Amassari
If you do this on behalf of the Makers, your name will be spoken and remembered by all Amassari. Good fortune to you.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_FAILKILL
### Joanna
The keepers are calling to other Progenitor automations, we must leave immediately. Initate emergency hyperspace jump!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_FAILKHARKALAAD
### Joanna
Commander, the Khar-Kaalad has been hit! We must withdraw!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_FAILAMASSARI
### Joanna
Commander, we failed to defend the Amassari ships. Critical mission failure!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_INTROA
### Joanna
Hyperspace jump complete. The Nightmare Gulf is still disrupting sensors. We would never have found this place without the Hagthar.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_INTROB
### Vashti
The Kiithless have built a stronghold in the nebula. There are heavy defenses. This must be Kidara's main base.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_INTROC
### Joanna
The Observer is here. It is being chained by EMP-beams of custom design. We must destroy these platforms to set the Observer free.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_ENGAGE
### Vashti
Kidara doesn't seem to be here, but I wouldn't rule out an ambush. Begin the attack!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWNA
### Kidara
I knew you arrogant Kiithid couldn't resist one last attempt to stop our plans. It will not matter. I will crush the Amassari and bring glory to Hiigara.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWNB
### Vashti
Your recklessness will kill us all! You can't just brute force your way to enlightenment, Kidara! The works of the Progenitors still contain many dangers!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWNC
### Joanna
Kidara, please see reason! This path to power is the path to ruin! It destroyed the ancient Hiigarans! It destroyed the Hagthar!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWND
### Kidara
Lies and cowardice. The secrets of the Progenitors are ours. If you will not join me, then die and be forgotten as you should have been on Kharak!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWNE
### Vashti
It's either Kidara's way or ours. We must stop her!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_EMP
### Kidara
Witness the power I command!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_TORPEDO
### Joanna
Commander, torpedoes incoming. Don't let them hit us!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_DESTRUCT
### Kidara
I curse you with my last breath, Kiithid! You'll die here with me. You will never see our Homeworld again!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_PLATFORM
### Joanna
dialog_id not found: s_nightmareGulf_dialog_platform_1

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_FREEOBSERVER
### Observer
The Observer awakens. Now we shall end this conflict, together.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_STATION
### Kidara
You may destroy my station, but I will fight to the last!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_FAILKHARKALAAD
### Joanna
Commander, the Khar-Kaalad has been hit! We must withdraw!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_WIN
### Joanna
Even to the end, Kidara couldn't allow others to win. The zeal of these Kiithless is disturbing.

### Vashti
She could have been so much more if she just set aside her pride for the sake of others. Now she's gone, along with all who followed her.

### Joanna
What matters is that the Observer is freed. The Amassari are coming in. They're celebrating.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_OBSERVERA
### Observer
Children of Hiigara. Continuity resumes. What was unbalanced is now steadied. The path resumes its shape.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_OBSERVERB
### Observer
The road of the ancients is fractured. All paths to Archara are blocked by ancient order. Only one road remains that will lead you home.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_OBSERVERC
### Observer
All paths converge at Ya' Axtche. Begin your quest at the Five Watchers. All other paths you find will fail.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_END
### Amassari
What you have done today is worthy of tales and legends, you have returned the Observer to us. Our thanks to you is without end.

### Joanna
We had to make our transgression right. But we have to ask, what is Ya' Axtche? What did the Observer mean?

### Amassari
It is an ancient word, one of our oldest, from before the days of our ancestors. Ya' Axtche is the World Tree, the beating heart of the universe.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_INTRO
### Hiigaran Commander
Hiigaran vessel, this is Captain Mahel. Praise Sajuuk you arrived, I couldn't break cover without an escort.

### Joanna
We're here to assist and extract you, Captain.

### Hiigaran Commander
I must transmit crucial data using this base's equipment, but the Iyatequa are on to me. I can't go without escort.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_GO
### Joanna
We'll cover you. Begin your run.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_WAVE1A
### Hiigaran Commander
Cangacians incoming! They are coming for the bounty on my head. The Iyatequa don't want the information I have getting out.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_WAVE1B
### Hiigaran Commander
Attention, a new wave has come out of hyperspace behind us.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_MINES
### Joanna
Commander, we've detected a mine field ahead. We must clear the path to give Captain Mahel a straight shot to the station.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_WAVE2
### Hiigaran Commander
Commander, another wave has appeared. The bounty must be huge to send a fleet this big just for me.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_COUNTDOWN
### Hiigaran Commander
I've docked. My crew has hooked up the transmitter... sending now.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_WAVE3
### Joanna
More ships have emerged from Hyperspace. The Iyatequa really want this information burried.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_KILLALL
### Joanna
Looks like the Cangaicans ran out of ships. All hostiles destroyed, proceed on mission.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_WIN
### Hiigaran Commander
Transmission to Lazarus base completed. It's done, the word is out.

### Joanna
The Cangacians are retreating. What information did you have?

### Hiigaran Commander
The Iyatequa have been selling our Progenitor control codes.

### Hiigaran Commander
If the powers here can command Progenitor units like we used to, it's going to be disasterous for the balance of power in this area.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_ALLYLOW
### Hiigaran Commander
Commander, our ship is in danger! Please assist!

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_FAIL
### Joanna
Mahel's ship is destroyed! Abort mission!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_INTRO
### Joanna
Wiracoda Gate. I never imagined we'd return so soon. We were so optimistic when we first arrived here...

### Gideon S'jet
Time is of the essence. The Freighter containing the Negotiator must be a specific distance to the gate in order to activate. Move quickly, Commander!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_GO
### Joanna
Admiral Enoch perished here ordering us to return home. We would honor his wishes by completing his final command.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_CONNECTION
### Gideon S'jet
The Freighter is in position. Standby, we are beginning system interlinks.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_PROGINCOMING
### Joanna
Progenitor defenses are reacting to our presence. Hold them off, don't yield this time!

### Gideon S'jet
Defend the Negotiator at all cost. We cannot lose it. It's our only chance to return home.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_PROGRETREATING
### Joanna
Commander, the Progenitors are relenting... they're becoming passive to our presence.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_CONTROL
### Gideon S'jet
The Negotiator is working. A little longer and we will regain control of the gate... and our route home.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_CATEINCOMING
### Catequil
Hiigarans! You think you can steal the Chintamani from me and not suffer the consequences? Prepare to die!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_DEVICELOST
### Gideon S'jet
No... what have you done, fools! The Negotiator... you've ruined everything!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_COMBAT
### Joanna
Commander, the Cangacian pirates are out for revenge. All ships, engage!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_CATEFILLER
### Catequil
You shoud have never come into our galaxy. I'm going to stuff your cold corpses through that hole that brought you here!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_MALIKA
### Keeper Malik
The Keeper has awakened.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_MALIKB
### Keeper Malik
The Keeper sees the enemy.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_MALIKC
### Keeper Malik
The Keeper will destroy!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_MALIKCOMMENT
### Joanna
What in Sajuuk's name is going on?

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_CATERETREATING
### Catequil
The accursed Hiigarans have angered the Makers. We'll leave them to their fate. All ships retreat!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_STANDGROUND
### Gideon S'jet
The cowards are fleeing. We must stand our ground. We might be able to retrieve the Negotiator's parts!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_REGENERATION
### Gideon S'jet
Commander, the Keeper has just self-repaired! This ability is nothing I've seen before.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_ESCAPE
### Joanna
Commander, we cannot win this fight. As long as this Keeper regenerates itself, we don't stand a chance. I'm afraid we must flee the gate once again.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_DEVICEKILLED
### Joanna
Commander, the Progenitor Negotiator was destroyed. We failed the special operation. We must retreat immediately!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_INTRO
### Joanna
Hyperspace jump completed. Is this another gate? It's not on any known charts. We're not reading the errant Keeper on sensors.

### Gideon S'jet
These two corrupted derelicts emanate enormous energy. They must be the source of the Keeper's abnormal powers. We have to destroy them!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_COMBAT
### Gideon S'jet
Commander, as long as the Keeper is energized, it will have the ability to self-repair. Avoid it for now and focus on destroying the derelicts!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_OUTRO
### Gideon S'jet
We did it! The Keeper is eliminated. The malignant command signal has ceased. The Progenitors will halt their active phase at once.

### Joanna
Excellent work, Commander. You put a stop to the Progenitor incursion. You saved the galaxy.

### Gideon S'jet
We ended what we began by accident, but the door back home remains closed. We cannot give up on this quest. There will come another day.

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKSEE
### Keeper Malik
The keeper sees the enemy.

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKDESTROYA
### Keeper Malik
The keeper will destroy!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKDESTROYB
### Keeper Malik
The keeper will destroy!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKDEATH
### Keeper Malik
The keeper...

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKREGENA
### Gideon S'jet
The keeper is regenerating itself. It is pointless to attack it for now. Focus on the derelicts!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKREGENB
### Gideon S'jet
The keeper is still regenerating itself. It is pointless to attack it for now. Focus on the derelicts!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKWEAKENED
### Gideon S'jet
Commander, the Keeper is taking more damage than before. It's self-repair ability is weakening! Destroy the last derelict!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_DERELICTWAVE
### Joanna
Commander, the derelict is spawning a wave of hostile units!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_DERELICTDOWNA
### Gideon S'jet
The first derelict is destroyed. The energy field is weakening, but we must destroy the other one as well!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_DERELICTDOWNB
### Gideon S'jet
All derelicts neutralized. We did it! The energy field is dissipating. The Keeper is vulnerable now!

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_INTRO
### Joanna
Hyperspace jump completed. There's no sign of the raiders yet, we should take defensive positions.

### Toci Citalicue
We're fortunate to make it in time. Today my people will be protected and we may learn more about our attackers as well.

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_FIRSTWAVE
### Joanna
There they are. Hostile units are on approach vectors. Prepare for contact!

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_NEXTWAVE
### Joanna
Commander, another wave is approaching!

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_WIN
### Joanna
The raid has failed, we've held the line. Salvage teams are already scanning the debris for anything of interest from the attacking ships.

### Toci Citalicue
Commander, these vessels belong to the Tecuban. But why would they carry out raids against us? They've never been this desperate.

### Joanna
What are the Tecuban? Are they a people like the Chicuat, subjects of the Empire?

### Toci Citalicue
Yes. Like us, they are a people who live within the Empire. But they have never been openly hostile to us or any other. Perhaps they are taking advantage of the recent chaos?

### Joanna
Commander, we can't repel these raids forever. Like it or not, we'll need to get more involved in this internal dispute within the Empire.

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_STATIONLOW
### Toci Citalicue
Commander, our station can't withstand much more of this. My people are dying, do something!

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_FAIL
### Joanna
Commander, the station just disintegrated. We've failed... we must withdraw.

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_INTRO
### Joanna
We've found the base. It's active with many hostiles in the area. We're outnumbered, but if we engage carefully we can maximize the element of surprise.

### Toci Citalicue
This base is larger than I expected, which is troubling. Wipe it from this system to send a message. These raids will no longer be tolerated!

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_ALERT
### Joanna
Commander, we're being illuminated by active targeting. Hostile craft approaching.

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_WAVE
### Joanna
More enemy craft emerging from hyperspace.

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_BOSS
### Joanna
More enemies... strange... are that Vaygr craft? What are they doing here?

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_VAYGR
### Vaygr Commander
Hiigarans! Eliminate them immediately, there must be no witnesses!

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_WIN
### Joanna
All threats neutralized. There was no sign of Heyoka, but the Vaygr appearing here raises a lot of questions.

### Toci Citalicue
Who are these Vaygr? I have heard of the name, but nothing more.

### Joanna
The Vaygr are enemies of ours from a war almost two decades ago. Somehow they're here in Nimbus too.

### Toci Citalicue
So the Tecuban have allied with these Vaygr to pillage my people? This... this is worse than I imagined.

### Joanna
You have powerful allies now as well. If the Vaygr are involved, this is our fight too. Together we'll get to the bottom of this.

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_INTRO
### Joanna
Commander, the Vaygr are ahead. They appear to be patrolling a Progenitor artifact.

### Toci Citalicue
Why are these Vaygr interested in objects from the Makers?

### Joanna
To fulfill an ancient prophecy, originally. Like us the Vaygr understand how to use these ancient devices.

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_CONTACT
### Vaygr Commander
Hiigarans! You are meddling in affairs that are not of your business. May death be your reward!

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_WAVE
### Joanna
More Vaygr are emerging from hyperspace, Commander.

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_BOSS
### Vaygr Commander
You are far from home, Hiigarans! You will die here forgotten!

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_BOSS_LOW
### Vaygr Commander
Curse you, Hiigarans! You will never spoil the plans of Jochik Kaan, heir to the rightful Saju-ka!

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_WIN
### Joanna
All hostiles defeated. So Jochik Kaan is pulling the strings in this conflict. He must have some deeper plan here for the Vaygr to be this involved.

### Toci Citalicue
Yet another ruthless leader behind the attacks upon my people? It is not enough for the Tecuban to turn against us?

### Joanna
We must discover what Jochik Kaan is trying to achieve here. Once we do, we'll put a stop to it.

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_INTRO
### Joanna
Commander, the Vaygr are already in-system. Are we too late?

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_HEYOKA
### Jochik Kaan
You've obstructed my plans for the last time, Heyoka! I have no use for disobedient fools!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_SITUATION
### Toci Citalicue
The Vaygr are attacking the Tecuban? What is happening?

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_HIIGARANS
### Vaygr Commander
My lord, the Hiigarans have arrived. They are approaching for battle.

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_COMBAT
### Jochik Kaan
All my enemies have gathered... no matter. We will crush them all and take what we came for.

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_ACADEMYLOW
### Toci Citalicue
The Academy is under attack! Commander, do something!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_FAILACADEMY
### Joanna
The Academy has fallen... we can't stop Jochik. All ships, retreat immediately!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_JOCHIKDOWNA
### Jochik Kaan
Reposition the flagship. Deploy the reserves. Destroy the Hiigarans!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_JOCHIKDOWNB
### Jochik Kaan
Savor your insignificant victory today, Hiigarans! I will crush you the next time we meet. Consider that a promise.

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_JOCHIKRETURN
### Joanna
Jochik has returned. All forces, engage his ship immediately!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_TEPIN
### Tepin Papan
Commander, I've come to assist you! Our people shall not fail today!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_FAILTEPIN
### Joanna
Tepin Papan's vessel was destroyed. We can't stop Jochik. All ships, retreat immediately!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_WIN
### Toci Citalicue
The Tlapallan Academy is safe. My people are protected and our enemies are on the run... I can't believe we prevailed.

### Tepin Papan
The Tecuban have retreated. It seems Heyoka tried to get to the relic before Jochik did, and paid the price.

### Toci Citalicue
His greed brought him to pillage the future of my people for his own gratification. I don't mourn his death.

### Tepin Papan
Our people are safe for now, but the Chicuat need a voice to speak on their behalf among our allies. Toci, you could be that voice among the Hiigarans.

### Joanna
We would be grateful to have you aboard, Toci. Your people are always welcome among us.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_INTRO
### Chocoan Coatl
Blessings, Hiigarans The People are relieved that you are here. The pilgrimage will begin moving to the conjunction point.

### Joanna
Greetings. We are ready to assist the convoy. All ships on full alert, keep your eye out for incoming pirates.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_INTERLUDE
### Chocoan Coatl
Behold the splendor of the Maker's works. We are blessed that they have lasted this long after the cataclysm. Truly a timeless wonder.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_ARRIVAL
### Chocoan Coatl
More pilgrim ships have arrived to see the conjuction. Bless the Makers.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_DEVIATION
### Joanna
Chocoan what's going on? You're deviating from the path! We must protect the perimeter.

### Chocoan Coatl
It must be done. Our ways are... not to be questioned by outsiders. Please, maintain defensive positions.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_ATTACKA
### Joanna
Hostiles incoming. Protect the pilgrims. Intercept the attackers!

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_ATTACKB
### Joanna
More attacks incoming. Chocoan, we need your help here!

### Chocoan Coatl
I... please... I can't.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CATEQUIL
### Catequil
So we meet again, Hiigarans. You won't stop me this time. I'll have that treasure, even if I have to rip it out of every ship I see! Do not let any of them escape!

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CHANGE
### Joanna
More hostile incoming. Chocoan, what the hell is going on? We need your help or civilians will die!

### Chocoan Coatl
I... I cannot... do this any longer. We are coming to your aid, and to the hells with the Elders and their ambition!

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CATEQUILLOW
### Catequil
You won't always be so fortunate Hiigarans! A thousand curses upon you and your works!

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_WIN
### Joanna
Perimeter is clear. The attack is over. The pilgrims are safe.

### Chocoan Coatl
Under the grace of the Makers, the pilgrims are safe with minimal casualties. Thank you, Commander.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CONJUNCTIONA
### Chocoan Coatl
The Conjunction is the clearest sign that our Makers were powerful and wise. The messages they left in the alignment of the stars are profound, even if their exact meaning is lost.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CONJUNCTIONB
### Chocoan Coatl
Though there are signs and portents of a great change coming, there is hope also in this change. Yes there is uncertainty, but the signs point to a great relief.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_END
### Joanna
Chocoan, what was going on back there?

### Chocoan Coatl
I can only confess. Our Elders pervert these pilgrimages with their own causes and ambitions. We rake the ruins of the Makers, scoop them into our hulls, for some reason.

### Joanna
They're looking for some Progenitor technology in those asteroids, aren't they?

### Chocoan Coatl
It would seem to be so. The Elders will surely take retribution for my failure, so I am without a place for I surely cannot return. I am no longer Envoy, or shephard, of my people.

### Joanna
You are always welcome among us, Chocoan. The warmth you showed your people could be a great asset to us as an envoy to the Yaot in the future.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_FAIL
### Joanna
Commander, we have Pilgrim ships going down. Critical mission failure. Abort immediately.

## MISS010_G0_DIALOG
### Joanna
We have new intelligence revealing a pirate hideout.

### Joanna
But their main fleet is not anywhere on sensors.

## MISS010_G1_DIALOG
### Joanna
We should take this chance and wipe out this base before their fleet returns.

## MISS010_G_BOSS_DIALOG
### Joanna
The pirate fleet has returned! Let's finish them off!

## RAIDMISSION001_DIALOG_FINISH
### Joanna
The pirate fleet has been destroyed. Prisoners were collected among the survivors and we're collecting salvage.

### Joanna
Great work! I think the locals will appreciate the one less pirate base in the area.

## RAIDMISSION002_START_DIALOG
### Joanna
It looks like we beat the enemy fleet here. We should get into position while we have the time!

## RAIDMISSION002_BEACONS_DIALOG
### Joanna
The enemies have hijacked the nav beacons remotely. We cannot disable them in time, we have no choice but to destroy them!

## RAIDMISSION002_BEACONSDONE1_DIALOG
### Joanna
One beacon has been destroyed. Three more beacons to go.

## RAIDMISSION002_BEACONSDONE2_DIALOG
### Joanna
Two beacons have been destroyed. This should slow down the pirate fleet considerably.

## RAIDMISSION002_BEACONSDONE3_DIALOG
### Joanna
Three beacons have been destroyed. Almost there.

## RAIDMISSION002_BOSS_DIALOG
### Joanna
Something large has just emerged from hyperspace. It's the main pirate fleet! Defend the station!

## RAIDMISSION002_DIALOG_FINISH
### Joanna
The invaders have been repelled. It may take some time to rebuild the nav beacons, but the station should be safe again.

## RAIDMISSION002_DIALOG_FAIL
### Joanna
The station is lost. Fortunately most of the inhabitants evacuated during the battle.

## R003_START_DIALOG0
### Joanna
This base belongs to a group called the Fleet of Rams. It's in a position to threaten any other Hiigaran fleets that arrive in the area.

### Joanna
Now that we're in contact with enough allied fleets, we can strike this base and wipe it out.

## R003_BASEHP80_DIALOG0
### Joanna
The Fleet of Rams is here. Proceed with caution.

## R003_BASEHP60_DIALOG0
### Joanna
Another group of pirates appeared on our flank!

## R003_BASEHP40_DIALOG0
### Joanna
It looks like their flagship just emerged from hyperspace. The enemy commander is identifying himself as... Catequil the devisor. Sounds pretentious.

### Catequil
Who? Hiigarans? I don't have time for this nuisance. Eliminate them!

### Joanna
Here they come, prepare for a fight!

## R003_FINISH_DIALOG0
### Joanna
The enemy base has been destroyed and Catequil is on the run. We did it!

### Catequil
You have my attention now, Hiigarans. You'll regret this on our next meeting!

### Joanna
Any other Hiigaran refugees in the area will be in the clear, now. But we'll need to be wary of this Fleet of Rams... I have a feeling they'll be back.

## ST_BREACH_INTRO_1_DIALOG
### Joanna
We've arrived at the target destination. This base is sitting in a crucial defensive position. Escort the freighter filled with explosives to the station to destroy it.

How do we pass through this shield?

### Amassari
Two pillars generate the meteor shield that keeps the asteroids contained. They will need to be disabled so that you can pass, but the barrier repairs itself quickly. Be warned also, the Kakahl Amassari do not take kindly to interlopers. Please hurry!

Commander, the transmission from Lazarus contains secret information on Progenitor technology. Details are classified, but I'll need you to investigate a list of certain items.

### Joanna
The transmission has a priority directive attached to it, making these our official new orders. Let us begin immediately.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_B_T1_END
### Gideon S'jet
Excellent. We have harvested many required items from destroyed wreckages. Now I need you to find an intact Progenitor Cognition Node.

### Joanna
Commander, Gideon's secrecy can only mean he's working on something important. I wonder where his research will lead us.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_C_T1_END
### Gideon S'jet
Thank you, Commander. I will start my research on the Progenitor Cognition Node. I need you to acquire more components in the meantime. I left a list with your adjutant.

### Joanna
Commander, reading the list Gideon left us, I do not recognize any of these items. Maybe Ekekko, our liaison with the Iyatequa, can help us find them.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_A_T1_END
### Ekekko
Splendid, my friend. Splendid! These resources should be sufficient to make the right inquiries about ancient objects. I'll put out feelers, as they say.

### Joanna
I have an uneasy feeling about Ekekko's contacts. I hope we can make the right impression.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_B_T1_END
### Ekekko
You're in luck, friend! I managed to find a seller for some of the parts you are seeking. With a little luck and a hefty amount of credits, I can arrange to acquire them for you.

### Joanna
Thank you Ekekko. I'm sure we can find something in our cargo hold to exchange for credits.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_C_T1_END
### Joanna
Excellent news, Commander! We managed to acquire much of Gideon's list in the transaction. Only a few parts remain.

### Ekekko
I was able to haggle additional information. One of the parts you're seeking has cultural significance to the Yaot. A fleet under the command of Zaque Guahai is looking for it now. Good luck!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_A_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander! We recovered Yaot communication from the transmission logs of one of the downed ships.

### Guahai
...and continue scouring the region! Finding the Stambha has utmost priority. You will locate that reconnaissance disk, or there will be...

### Joanna
Interesting. Reconnaissance disks are usually part of a ship's integral data box. If we collect salvage from hostiles in the area, we might be able to find this item first.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_B_T1_END
### Joanna
We're in luck, we've recovered the reconnaissance disk Guahai is seeking. Navigation has the location of this Stambha. Hopefully it's the part Gideon is looking for...

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_C_T1_END
### Joanna
We have found the artifact and transferred it to the laboratory. Commander, the Yaot must know we have it, incoming transmission from Guahai.

### Guahai
Your blaspheme against the Makers will not be forgotten, Hiigarans! The Stambha is not supposed to be in your hands! Your transgression will be remembered.

### Joanna
It seems odd that the Yaot attach so much significance to a deep-space antenna. But then, our own people believed Sajuuk was a deity before finding the ship bearing the name.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_A_T1_END
### Joanna
We have scanned the sector successfully, but discovered nothing of significance. Gideon, what are we looking for?

### Gideon S'jet
Commander, in order to use the antenna we must find a specific piece of Progenitor equipment to match it as a receiver. An adapter also must be build to connect them.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_B_T1_END
### Gideon S'jet
Resources received and processed. We should focus our efforts on finding the receiver component, but I have come up with no leads yet.

### Ekekko
Well and met, friend. I have heard vague rumors that an object of the given description is in possession of a powerful outlaw. I suggest stirring up the local underworld.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_C_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, many criminals have heard stories about the object in question. It is rumored to be stolen in a legendary heist from a Tanoch temple.

### Ekekko
The Tanoch? I'm afraid I don't have many contacts with the Empire. But didn't you make friends with one of their commanders?

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_A_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, we have succeeded in opening a communication channel to Tepin Papan. Sending a request for assistance now.

### Tepin Papan
Greeting, Commander. It has been too long. The information you seek is rather difficult to obtain, but for a few favors, I might be able to take the risk on your behalf.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_B_T1_END
### Tepin Papan
Thank you for your help. We call the artifact you seek the Chintamani. It was indeed stolen recently. If you're willing to provide some more assistance, I can send you the report.

### Joanna
We appreciate the help, Commander. We stand ready to assist you.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_C_T1_END
### Tepin Papan
The Empire is most satisfied with your work. I am sending you the report now. We suspect a Cangacian pirate was responsible for the theft. Good luck tracking him down.

### Joanna
Thank you, Commander. We will pass on the reports to Lazarus Base to be processed.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_A_T1_END
### Gideon S'jet
Commander, I formulated a new training program for the crew that will man the device once it's constructed. We should begin practice immediately.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_B_T1_END
### Gideon S'jet
Your officer’s flexibility and adaptability is to be commended. What remains to be seen is combined integration between officers, crew, and ship.

### Joanna
Commander, the training program teaches the crew to operate a hyperspace gate. Are we... trying to go home?

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_C_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, we're receiving a coded transmission from a Yaot source. It's Guahai.

### Guahai
Your theft of the Stambha remains inexcusable, Hiigarans. However, I am willing to pardon this offense if you follow my orders

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_A_T1_END
### Guahai
You are wise to follow my command, outsider. We will transmit specific alloy recipes for your refinery. Make sure your foundry masters adhere to them precisely!

### Joanna
Commander, Guahai plays all tough, but he seems worried. He must need us to reinforce his fleet out here.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_B_T1_END
### Guahai
The alloys you provided were crude, but acceptable. I am instructing my fleet’s engineers to send you specifications for parts we require. If you do this, I might consider your slight expunged.

### Joanna
Guahai's fleet must be in dire need of repairs, Commander. We might get off the hook easily this time.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_C_T1_END
### Guahai
Hiigarans, our business has concluded, your sin is hereby absolved. Be wary of crossing our paths in the future. Repeated offenses will not be forgiven.

### Joanna
Our altercation with the Yaot is resolved for now. We should resume our quest to locate the last component for Gideon's device.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_A_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, we found the intel we need. The Fleet of Rams indeed have the artifact we seek. It is in the possession of Catequil, one of their Lieutenants.

### Gideon S'jet
Outstanding. Commander, please retrieve the component as soon as possible. I can't wait to finalize the construction of the Progenitor Negotiator.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_B_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, we have an incoming transmission. It's a Cangacian frequency.

### Catequil
I know what you are trying to do, Hiigarans. Obtaining this treasure has gained me great fame among my people. I will not hand it over to you willingly!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_C_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, we retrieved the stolen Progenitor artifact from Catequil and transferred it to the laboratory.

### Gideon S'jet
Finally! This receiver perfectly matches the antenna. I will see to the completion of the Progenitor Negotiator at once. This device will shake the history of Nimbus.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_A_T1_END
### Gideon S'jet
Your officer has been trained to use the new device I have engineered. For security reasons, I cannot specify what it does until we reach the special operation area.

### Joanna
Commander, chatter among the crew indicates Gideon's device will communicate to a hyperspace gate. I just hope we won't have another gate disaster like when we entered Nimbus.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_B_T1_END
### Gideon S'jet
Excellent, the freighter now has the parts needed for the special operation. Next, we must perform one final systems check so all can be ready.

### Joanna
If this special operation is what I think it is, I can't help but think of how we got into all of this in the first place. Admiral Enoch's final command of returning home always felt impossible to complete.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_C_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, all forces are ready for the special operation.

### Gideon S'jet
Excellent. You have done well, Commander. Very soon we will embark on the most important operation of our careers. All our efforts will pay off, I promise!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY10_A_T1_END

Commander… we came across this at the gate. It’s a log transmission from Admiral Enoch. I’ve sent it to your private mail to review on your own.

Thank you, Commander. I will start my research on the Progenitor Cognition Node. I need you to acquire more components in the meantime. I left a list with your adjutant.

### Joanna
Commander, reading the list Gideon left us, I do not recognize any of these items. Maybe Ekekko, our liaison with the Iyatequa, can help us find them.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_A_T2_END
### Ekekko
Splendid, my friend. Splendid! These resources should be sufficient to make the right inquiries about ancient objects. I'll put out feelers, as they say.

### Joanna
I have an uneasy feeling about Ekekko's contacts. I hope we can make the right impression.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_B_T2_END
### Ekekko
You're in luck, friend! I managed to find a seller for some of the parts you are seeking. With a little luck and a hefty amount of credits, I can arrange to acquire them for you.

### Joanna
Thank you Ekekko. I'm sure we can find something in our cargo hold to exchange for credits.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_C_T2_END
### Joanna
Excellent news, Commander! We managed to acquire much of Gideon's list in the transaction. Only a few parts remain.

### Ekekko
I was able to haggle additional information. One of the parts you're seeking has cultural significance to the Yaot. A fleet under the command of Zaque Guahai is looking for it now. Good luck!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_A_T2_END
### Joanna
Commander! We recovered Yaot communication from the transmission logs of one of the downed ships.

### Guahai
...and continue scouring the region! Finding the Stambha has utmost priority. You will locate that reconnaissance disk, or there will be...

### Joanna
Interesting. Reconnaissance disks are usually part of a ship's integral data box. If we collect salvage from hostiles in the area, we might be able to find this item first.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_B_T2_END
### Joanna
We're in luck, we've recovered the reconnaissance disk Guahai is seeking. Navigation has the location of this Stambha. Hopefully it's the part Gideon is looking for...

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_C_T2_END
### Joanna
We have found the artifact and transferred it to the laboratory. Commander, the Yaot must know we have it, incoming transmission from Guahai.

### Guahai
Your blaspheme against the Makers will not be forgotten, Hiigarans! The Stambha is not supposed to be in your hands! Your transgression will be remembered.

### Joanna
It seems odd that the Yaot attach so much significance to a deep-space antenna. But then, our own people believed Sajuuk was a deity before finding the ship bearing the name.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_A_T2_END
### Joanna
We have scanned the sector successfully, but discovered nothing of significance. Gideon, what are we looking for?

### Gideon S'jet
Commander, in order to use the antenna we must find a specific piece of Progenitor equipment to match it as a receiver. An adapter also must be build to connect them.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_B_T2_END
### Gideon S'jet
Resources received and processed. We should focus our efforts on finding the receiver component, but I have come up with no leads yet.

### Ekekko
Well and met, friend. I have heard vague rumors that an object of the given description is in possession of a powerful outlaw. I suggest stirring up the local underworld.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_C_T2_END
### Joanna
Commander, many criminals have heard stories about the object in question. It is rumored to be stolen in a legendary heist from a Tanoch temple.

### Ekekko
The Tanoch? I'm afraid I don't have many contacts with the Empire. But didn't you make friends with one of their commanders?

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_A_T2_END
### Joanna
Commander, we have succeeded in opening a communication channel to Tepin Papan. Sending a request for assistance now.

### Tepin Papan
Greeting, Commander. It has been too long. The information you seek is rather difficult to obtain, but for a few favors, I might be able to take the risk on your behalf.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_B_T2_END
### Tepin Papan
Thank you for your help. We call the artifact you seek the Chintamani. It was indeed stolen recently. If you're willing to provide some more assistance, I can send you the report.

### Joanna
We appreciate the help, Commander. We stand ready to assist you.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_C_T2_END
### Tepin Papan
The Empire is most satisfied with your work. I am sending you the report now. We suspect a Cangacian pirate was responsible for the theft. Good luck tracking him down.

### Joanna
Thank you, Commander. We will pass on the reports to Lazarus Base to be processed.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_A_T2_END
### Gideon S'jet
Commander, I formulated a new training program for the crew that will man the device once it's constructed. We should begin practice immediately.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_B_T2_END
### Gideon S'jet
Your officer’s flexibility and adaptability is to be commended. What remains to be seen is combined integration between officers, crew, and ship.

### Joanna
Commander, the training program teaches the crew to operate a hyperspace gate. Are we... trying to go home?

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_C_T2_END
### Joanna
Commander, we're receiving a coded transmission from a Yaot source. It's Guahai.

### Guahai
Your theft of the Stambha remains inexcusable, Hiigarans. However, I am willing to pardon this offense if you follow my orders

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_A_T2_END
### Guahai
You are wise to follow my command, outsider. We will transmit specific alloy recipes for your refinery. Make sure your foundry masters adhere to them precisely!

### Joanna
Commander, Guahai plays all tough, but he seems worried. He must need us to reinforce his fleet out here.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_B_T2_END
### Guahai
The alloys you provided were crude, but acceptable. I am instructing my fleet’s engineers to send you specifications for parts we require. If you do this, I might consider your slight expunged.

### Joanna
Guahai's fleet must be in dire need of repairs, Commander. We might get off the hook easily this time.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_C_T2_END
### Guahai
Hiigarans, our business has concluded, your sin is hereby absolved. Be wary of crossing our paths in the future. Repeated offenses will not be forgiven.

### Joanna
Our altercation with the Yaot is resolved for now. We should resume our quest to locate the last component for Gideon's device.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_A_T2_END
### Joanna
Commander, we found the intel we need. The Fleet of Rams indeed have the artifact we seek. It is in the possession of Catequil, one of their Lieutenants.

### Gideon S'jet
Outstanding. Commander, please retrieve the component as soon as possible. I can't wait to finalize the construction of the Progenitor Negotiator.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_B_T2_END
### Joanna
Commander, we have an incoming transmission. It's a Cangacian frequency.

### Catequil
I know what you are trying to do, Hiigarans. Obtaining this treasure has gained me great fame among my people. I will not hand it over to you willingly!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_C_T2_END
### Joanna
Commander, we retrieved the stolen Progenitor artifact from Catequil and transferred it to the laboratory.

### Gideon S'jet
Finally! This receiver perfectly matches the antenna. I will see to the completion of the Progenitor Negotiator at once. This device will shake the history of Nimbus.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_A_T2_END
### Gideon S'jet
Your officer has been trained to use the new device I have engineered. For security reasons, I cannot specify what it does until we reach the special operation area.

### Joanna
Commander, chatter among the crew indicates Gideon's device will communicate to a hyperspace gate. I just hope we won't have another gate disaster like when we entered Nimbus.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_B_T2_END
### Gideon S'jet
Excellent, the freighter now has the parts needed for the special operation. Next, we must perform one final systems check so all can be ready.

### Joanna
If this special operation is what I think it is, I can't help but think of how we got into all of this in the first place. Admiral Enoch's final command of returning home always felt impossible to complete.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_C_T2_END
### Joanna
Commander, all forces are ready for the special operation.

### Gideon S'jet
Excellent. You have done well, Commander. Very soon we will embark on the most important operation of our careers. All our efforts will pay off, I promise!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY10_A_T2_END
### Joanna
Commander… we came across this at the gate. It’s a log transmission from Admiral Enoch. I’ve sent it to your private mail to review on your own.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_A_T3_END
### Gideon S'jet
Commander, the transmission from Lazarus contains secret information on Progenitor technology. Details are classified, but I'll need you to investigate a list of certain items.

### Joanna
The transmission has a priority directive attached to it, making these our official new orders. Let us begin immediately.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_B_T3_END
### Gideon S'jet
Excellent. We have harvested many required items from destroyed wreckages. Now I need you to find an intact Progenitor Cognition Node.

### Joanna
Commander, Gideon's secrecy can only mean he's working on something important. I wonder where his research will lead us.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_C_T3_END

This Progenitor behavior is unlike anything we’ve seen before. They’re actively attacking now, they’ve only been passive before.

### Gideon S'jet
Everything started with the corrupted Keeper at the gate. The last time Progenitor devices behaved like this was many thousands of years ago... at the close of the Progenitor Empire. History must not repeat!

We have delivered the raw material to the refineries in need, Commander. The defenses are strong for now, but they won't hold off the Progenitor attacks forever.

Commander, what we have gathered indicates the active Progenitors being controlled by a malignant frequency. It must come from the corrupted Keeper.

We delivered the rare material to support the defense forces. Most garrisons are still holding strong, but the continual assaults are starting to weaken many sectors.

I analyzed the command frequency. I don't understand... It's absurdly powerful. I suspect another Progenitor technology must be channeling energy to the Keeper.

Something else is energizing the corrupted Keeper? Perhaps destroying this source will neutralize its strange regenerative powers.

We provided the parts to replenish the defense forces. Their resolve is still strong, but at this rate of attrition, many systems won't be able to hold out much longer.

Commander, I finally found the source of the errant Keeper's signal. It is coming from a system in Cangacian space.

It is our pleasure to help wherever we can. Lazarus offers assistance to all friendly factions still recovering from the recent Progenitor assaults.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY02_T1_END
### Toci Citalicue
We’ve been able to restore critical machinery which will help us stabilize our industry. Thank you, it wouldn’t be possible without your assistance.

Commander, I'm wondering why the Empire isn't helping the Chicuat. It seems the Tanoch have abandoned these people to their fate.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY03_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, we found cargo belonging to the Chicuat. Foodstuffs, basic machinery, textiles… not the valuable loot you'd expect.

My people have suffered many raids on basic infrastructure lately. Whoever is behind these attacks is trying to destabilize us even further. This madness is inhumane!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY04_T1_END

We have a deal! My friends among the Iyatequa have agreed to open up new shipping lanes to the Chicuat and supply basic goods.

Greetings Commander. I'm pleased to hear you've been assisting my kinsmen, the Chicuat. I'm surprised you suspect the Tecuban behind these attacks, but I'm sending what information I have.

### Toci Citalicue
I'm surprised you know Tepin Papan. Though many Tanoch hold my people with destain, every Chicuat is proud to serve in the Empire. I'm relieved to know we have his assistance.

### Joanna
We met Tepin Papan in the Empty Quarter shortly after we arrived in Nimbus. Lazarus Base will process his information on the Tecuban.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY07_T1_END
### Toci Citalicue
Commander, we found communications data among the wreckages that contains Heyoka's name. He must be involved with the local criminal network.

I'm astounded the Tecuban would fall in with criminals. They may be destitute as we are, but even they would not normally raise a fist against other Tanoch.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY08_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, we retrieved more communications data between the criminals and Heyoka. We were able to trace his last location to a system called Acatla.

### Toci Citalicue
Acatla? How can this be? That is well within Chicuat borders. Commander, I implore you, please investigate immediately!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY09_T1_END
### Toci Citalicue
Hiigaran combat power is impressive, Commander. The Chicuat have always suffered persecution within the Empire. It feels very good to have a powerful ally for once.

We understand the desperation. Only a century ago, we were just six hundred thousand exiles fighting an interstellar empire to retake our lost homeworld. We stand by your side in this conflict.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY11_T1_END
### Tepin Papan
It has been rumored the Vaygr are sheltering in Tecuban space. I will learn what I can, but these Vaygr have the patrongae of the Emperor. It will be difficult.

The Vaygr are friends of the Emperor? Perhaps this is why the Empire is turning a deaf ear to our current plight. We may be hated, but never has the Empire ignored us as they have in this time.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY12_T1_END

Commander, we are not finding any hard evidence of the Vaygr's activity around these systems. We're only picking up whispered rumors among the locals.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY13_T1_END
### Toci Citalicue
Commander, our plan to gain the trust of the local people has worked. Our best lead comes from a nearby outpost.

That is great news. They claim to have information that could match our description of the Vaygr. But they want us to help them with something before they hand it over.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY14_T1_END

Commander, we received the information from the locals. It seems someone overheard a frigate crew boasting about working for powerful outsiders. This could be the Vaygr!

Commander, onboard one of these vessels we found communications data with a Vaygr frequency. This is the lead we've been waiting for.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY17_T1_END
### Tepin Papan
Commander, I've expended every avenue to gather more information. To probe further would risk my position, and I cannot help my people if I'm dismissed from my post. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

### Toci Citalicue
Even our allies in the Empire can no longer help us. What does Jochik have to gain through brutalizing my people? What does he want?

### Ekekko
My friends, if the answer can't be aquired through proper channels we should turn to the local markets. Let the power of coin open the door between you and the answer you seek.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY18_T1_END
### Ekekko
It's a deal, friends! A reputable source claims to have spoken to Jochik himself. He's seeking a very specific relic from the Makers, though I did not catch it's specifics.

### Toci Citalicue
My people have hidden many objects of the Makers we retain for study and safekeeping. Jochik delivers pain, suffering, and ruin to my people all to attain an object of the Makers? Monster!

Commander, we found a lot of data logs concerning Progenitor objects on these ships. We'll need to process them quickly. I'm sending them to the lab now.

Commander, the Tecuban raiders are well armed and confident. Heyoka and Jochik must be coordinating closely for this operation.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY21_T1_END
### Gideon S'jet
Thanks for your assistance, Commander. With the provided information, I was able to pinpoint the particular object in question. Jochik is seeking a very rare object the Tanoch call a Baetyl.

### Toci Citalicue
Curse the Vaygr! They're after the Baetyl? It's placed at the Tlapallan Academy. It's one of our most populated learning centers! We must inform the Elders immediately!

### Toci Citalicue
I'm deeply thankful for your support. This trade will surely allieviate some suffering among my people. I just hope we can put a stop to the raids soon.

### Tepin Papan
Greetings Commander. I'm pleased to hear you've been assisting my kinsmen, the Chicuat. I'm surprised you suspect the Tecuban behind these attacks, but I'm sending what information I have.

### Toci Citalicue
I'm surprised you know Tepin Papan. Though many Tanoch hold my people with destain, every Chicuat is proud to serve in the Empire. I'm relieved to know we have his assistance.

### Joanna
We met Tepin Papan in the Empty Quarter shortly after we arrived in Nimbus. Lazarus Base will process his information on the Tecuban.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY07_T3_END
### Toci Citalicue
Commander, we found communications data among the wreckages that contains Heyoka's name. He must be involved with the local criminal network.

### Joanna
I'm astounded the Tecuban would fall in with criminals. They may be destitute as we are, but even they would not normally raise a fist against other Tanoch.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY08_T3_END
### Joanna
Commander, we retrieved more communications data between the criminals and Heyoka. We were able to trace his last location to a system called Acatla.

### Toci Citalicue
Acatla? How can this be? That is well within Chicuat borders. Commander, I implore you, please investigate immediately!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY09_T3_END
### Toci Citalicue
Hiigaran combat power is impressive, Commander. The Chicuat have always suffered persecution within the Empire. It feels very good to have a powerful ally for once.

### Joanna
We understand the desperation. Only a century ago, we were just six hundred thousand exiles fighting an interstellar empire to retake our lost homeworld. We stand by your side in this conflict.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY11_T3_END
### Tepin Papan
It has been rumored the Vaygr are sheltering in Tecuban space. I will learn what I can, but these Vaygr have the patrongae of the Emperor. It will be difficult.

### Toci Citalicue
The Vaygr are friends of the Emperor? Perhaps this is why the Empire is turning a deaf ear to our current plight. We may be hated, but never has the Empire ignored us as they have in this time.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY12_T3_END
### Joanna
Commander, we are not finding any hard evidence of the Vaygr's activity around these systems. We're only picking up whispered rumors among the locals.

### Toci Citalicue
The people have been through a lot lately. They're scared and uncertain. We'll need to gain their trust if we want to get someone to talk.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY13_T3_END
### Toci Citalicue
Commander, our plan to gain the trust of the local people has worked. Our best lead comes from a nearby outpost.

### Joanna
That is great news. They claim to have information that could match our description of the Vaygr. But they want us to help them with something before they hand it over.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY14_T3_END
### Joanna
Commander, we received the information from the locals. It seems someone overheard a frigate crew boasting about working for powerful outsiders. This could be the Vaygr!

### Toci Citalicue
I'm glad we could do something for the local people. Let's hunt down the Vaygr now and find out what they are scheming with the Tecuban!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY15_T3_END
### Joanna
Commander, onboard one of these vessels we found communications data with a Vaygr frequency. This is the lead we've been waiting for.

### Toci Citalicue
It's disturbing how many here are drawn to Vaygr promises of power, though I am not surprised. The Tecuban have even less than we do, and have more to gain from such an alliance.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY17_T3_END
### Tepin Papan
Commander, I've expended every avenue to gather more information. To probe further would risk my position, and I cannot help my people if I'm dismissed from my post. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

### Toci Citalicue
Even our allies in the Empire can no longer help us. What does Jochik have to gain through brutalizing my people? What does he want?

### Ekekko
My friends, if the answer can't be aquired through proper channels we should turn to the local markets. Let the power of coin open the door between you and the answer you seek.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY18_T3_END
### Ekekko
It's a deal, friends! A reputable source claims to have spoken to Jochik himself. He's seeking a very specific relic from the Makers, though I did not catch it's specifics.

### Toci Citalicue
My people have hidden many objects of the Makers we retain for study and safekeeping. Jochik delivers pain, suffering, and ruin to my people all to attain an object of the Makers? Monster!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY19_T3_END
### Joanna
Commander, we found a lot of data logs concerning Progenitor objects on these ships. We'll need to process them quickly. I'm sending them to the lab now.

### Gideon S'jet
At your service, Commander. What a fascinating quantity of data. I'll do my best to come up with answers as soon as possible.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY20_T3_END
### Joanna
Commander, the Tecuban raiders are well armed and confident. Heyoka and Jochik must be coordinating closely for this operation.

### Toci Citalicue
All of this carngae for the greed of one and the ambition of the other! We must stop them, my people cannot withstand their assault for much longer!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY21_T3_END
### Gideon S'jet
Thanks for your assistance, Commander. With the provided information, I was able to pinpoint the particular object in question. Jochik is seeking a very rare object the Tanoch call a Baetyl.

### Toci Citalicue
Curse the Vaygr! They're after the Baetyl? It's placed at the Tlapallan Academy. It's one of our most populated learning centers! We must inform the Elders immediately!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY01_T4_END
### Toci Citalicue
Greetings, Commander. I am Toci Citalicue, and I will act as liaison between you and my people, the Chicuat. I cannot thank you enough for your aid in this troubled time.

### Joanna
It is our pleasure to help wherever we can. Lazarus offers assistance to all friendly factions still recovering from the recent Progenitor assaults.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY02_T4_END
### Toci Citalicue
We’ve been able to restore critical machinery which will help us stabilize our industry. Thank you, it wouldn’t be possible without your assistance.

### Joanna
Commander, I'm wondering why the Empire isn't helping the Chicuat. It seems the Tanoch have abandoned these people to their fate.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY03_T4_END
### Joanna
Commander, we found cargo belonging to the Chicuat. Foodstuffs, basic machinery, textiles… not the valuable loot you'd expect.

### Toci Citalicue
My people have suffered many raids on basic infrastructure lately. Whoever is behind these attacks is trying to destabilize us even further. This madness is inhumane!

Hello, good friend! After some prying, I've learned Cangacian pirates have been hired by my fellows to raid some Yaot Pilgrims entering the area. What more, I cannot say.

### Joanna
Yaot pilgrims in the Empty Quarter? Commander, this might be of interest to Hiigaran security. We should find out more about what's going on.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY02_T1_END
### Ekekko
Greetings, friend! My fellow tradesmen, of course, say nothing to me about their plans. But plenty of Cangacian marauders were eager to boast of their exploits.

### Joanna
Commander, the pirates believe there is valuable treasure on the Yaot pilgrim ships. But for now they were only able to capture basic civilian goods.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY03_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, we can't find any traces of the Yaot pilgrimage. The area is swarming with pirates. They must know something we don't.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY04_T1_END
### Crew Member
Commander, some of the containers we've recovered have casualties. Many were deceased, but we also recovered survivors in critical condition.

### Joanna
This is abhorrent... these can only be Yaot civilians! I am ordering them taken to medical away.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY05_T1_END
### Joanna
Commander, we talked to the Yaot survivors. They were indeed part of the pilgrimage. They gave us their normal comm frequency, so we can contact the formation leader directly.

### Chocoan Coatl
A warm blessing to you, Hiigarans. I am Chocoan Coatl, Envoy of the Yaot Federation and Shepard of this Conjunction. I thank you for saving the lives of my fellow pilgrims.

### Joanna
Greetings Envoy Coatl. We greet you on behalf of the Hiigaran colonies in this area. Your pilgrimage has caused an uprising of pirate activity here. Our authorities are worried about the security situation.

### Chocoan Coatl
We are but simple Pilgrims Commander, bound by our faith to visit conjunctions seen in our sky. Until now we had no need for escort, for none took an interest in our mission. This seems to have changed without reason.

### Joanna
Commander, we can't leave these civilians defenseless against the pirates. It's unethical to stand by and allow it, we must help them.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY06_T1_END
### Chocoan Coatl
Blessings, Hiigarans. You have my thanks for these parts for our vessels. I am seeing to their distribution now.

### Crew Member
Commander, as requested we have tracked the delivery of the provided parts. It seems like some ships are clearly being prioritized over others.

### Joanna
Interesting. Could these be the treasure ships the pirates were talking about? We need to find out more.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY07_T1_END
### Crew Member
Commander, we have a direct communication from the Cangacian pirates.

### Catequil
You continue to meddle in affairs that are none of your business! I will have my treasure, and you will stop foiling my plans!

### Joanna
Treasure? What treasure could be aboard these civilian ships? Have you no conscience terrorizing the innocent?

### Catequil
Innocent? You Hiigarans are so naive with your trust it's offensive. If you stand in my way again, I will crush you along with these charlatans you defend!

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY08_T1_END
### Chocoan Coatl
You gift us with your compassion, commander. Most would not go out of their way to defend a stranger.

### Joanna
We Hiigarans were once nearly defenseless refugees ourselves. But what is this pilgrimage, what drives you?

### Chocoan Coatl
Our people have made these voyages for centuries. Our history tells us great events coincide with the conjunctions, which must be witnessed. Some of them tell us of the presence of the Makers among us still.

### Joanna
This is fascinating... but I don't understand why your group would be targeted. Do you carry something special when observing the conjunction? An artifact of some kind?

### Chocoan Coatl
I'm afraid details such as these... must remain unspoken for now. I have much work to do, coordinating with the Elders. We will speak again.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY09_T1_END
### Yaot Commander
Hiigaran commander, we have received your request for further information. The Yaot Federation cannot comment on the pilgrimages of the conjunctions. This is strictly a civilian affair, and outside the official business of the Federation. Good day.

That seemed unusually terse. We might need to think outside the box and find our other contacts for further information.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY10_T1_END

Hello Commander! Thank you for the artifact, this will buy the information you seek. You're looking for more information on these conjunction pilgrimages?

### Joanna
Yes. We're protecting the civilian pilgrims on their travels. Many believe some sort of treasure among their ships. We suspect some kind of involvement from the Yaot Elders.

### Tepin Papan
Interesting. Our intelligence concurs with your assessment. We have also suspected the Yaot have some other purpose behind these pilgrimages, something that has direct oversight from their council of Elders.

### Joanna
Could this be some secret agenda by their leadership? Are they searching for something? Searching for treasures?

### Tepin Papan
The only other thing I can tell you is that our scouts detected ruins of the Makers there previously. What they do with them, we don't know. Good hunting!

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY11_T1_END

Commander, we've picked up a classified investigation report on the Yaot pilgrimage from one of the hostile vessels. Decryption process initiated.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY12_T1_END

Commander, we've collected ore from the asteroids near the astral conjunction site. The material is transferred into the laboratory to be examined.

Blessings upon you, Commander. My people wish to convey their deepest thanks for your assistance. We are ready to engage the conjunction event in Ze Tavaan. May the Makers be with us.

### Joanna
Envoy Coatl, this is Cangacian territory. It is almost certain the Cancagians will be waiting there in ambush. Is this event really so important to your people's faith that it's worth risking their lives?

### Chocoan Coatl
The decision... is not mine to make. We are guided by the wisdom of the Elders. But should you wish to provide escort, the people would be relieved to know we are under your protection.

### Chocoan Coatl
Our people have made these voyages for centuries. Our history tells us great events coincide with the conjunctions, which must be witnessed. Some of them tell us of the presence of the Makers among us still.

### Joanna
This is fascinating... but I don't understand why your group would be targeted. Do you carry something special when observing the conjunction? An artifact of some kind?

### Chocoan Coatl
I'm afraid details such as these... must remain unspoken for now. I have much work to do, coordinating with the Elders. We will speak again.

### Yaot Commander
Hiigaran commander, we have received your request for further information. The Yaot Federation cannot comment on the pilgrimages of the conjunctions. This is strictly a civilian affair, and outside the official business of the Federation. Good day.

### Joanna
That seemed unusually terse. We might need to think outside the box and find our other contacts for further information.

### Tepin Papan
Hello Commander! Thank you for the artifact, this will buy the information you seek. You're looking for more information on these conjunction pilgrimages?

### Joanna
Yes. We're protecting the civilian pilgrims on their travels. Many believe some sort of treasure among their ships. We suspect some kind of involvement from the Yaot Elders.

### Tepin Papan
Interesting. Our intelligence concurs with your assessment. We have also suspected the Yaot have some other purpose behind these pilgrimages, something that has direct oversight from their council of Elders.

### Joanna
Could this be some secret agenda by their leadership? Are they searching for something? Searching for treasures?

### Tepin Papan
The only other thing I can tell you is that our scouts detected ruins of the Makers there previously. What they do with them, we don't know. Good hunting!

### Crew Member
Commander, we've picked up a classified investigation report on the Yaot pilgrimage from one of the hostile vessels. Decryption process initiated.

### Joanna
Most interesting. This is a detailed report on the procedure of the pilgrim's convoy at astral conjunction events. I want this evaluated as quickly as possible!

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY12_T3_END
### Joanna
Commander, we've collected ore from the asteroids near the astral conjunction site. The material is transferred into the laboratory to be examined.

### Gideon S'jet
Commander, I have been monitoring the situation and I will assist in the examination. If there is anything here involving the Progenitors, I will find it.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY13_T3_END
### Chocoan Coatl
Blessings upon you, Commander. My people wish to convey their deepest thanks for your assistance. We are ready to engage the conjunction event in Ze Tavaan. May the Makers be with us.

### Joanna
Envoy Coatl, this is Cangacian territory. It is almost certain the Cancagians will be waiting there in ambush. Is this event really so important to your people's faith that it's worth risking their lives?

### Chocoan Coatl
The decision... is not mine to make. We are guided by the wisdom of the Elders. But should you wish to provide escort, the people would be relieved to know we are under your protection.

### Ekekko
Hello, good friend! After some prying, I've learned Cangacian pirates have been hired by my fellows to raid some Yaot Pilgrims entering the area. What more, I cannot say.

### Joanna
Yaot pilgrims in the Empty Quarter? Commander, this might be of interest to Hiigaran security. We should find out more about what's going on.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY02_T4_END
### Ekekko
Greetings, friend! My fellow tradesmen, of course, say nothing to me about their plans. But plenty of Cangacian marauders were eager to boast of their exploits.

### Joanna
Commander, the pirates believe there is valuable treasure on the Yaot pilgrim ships. But for now they were only able to capture basic civilian goods.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY03_T4_END
### Joanna
Commander, we can't find any traces of the Yaot pilgrimage. The area is swarming with pirates. They must know something we don't.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY04_T4_END
### Crew Member
Commander, some of the containers we've recovered have casualties. Many were deceased, but we also recovered survivors in critical condition.

### Joanna
This is abhorrent... these can only be Yaot civilians! I am ordering them taken to medical away.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY05_T4_END
### Joanna
Commander, we talked to the Yaot survivors. They were indeed part of the pilgrimage. They gave us their normal comm frequency, so we can contact the formation leader directly.

### Chocoan Coatl
A warm blessing to you, Hiigarans. I am Chocoan Coatl, Envoy of the Yaot Federation and Shepard of this Conjunction. I thank you for saving the lives of my fellow pilgrims.

### Joanna
Greetings Envoy Coatl. We greet you on behalf of the Hiigaran colonies in this area. Your pilgrimage has caused an uprising of pirate activity here. Our authorities are worried about the security situation.

### Chocoan Coatl
We are but simple Pilgrims Commander, bound by our faith to visit conjunctions seen in our sky. Until now we had no need for escort, for none took an interest in our mission. This seems to have changed without reason.

### Joanna
Commander, we can't leave these civilians defenseless against the pirates. It's unethical to stand by and allow it, we must help them.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY06_T4_END
### Chocoan Coatl
Blessings, Hiigarans. You have my thanks for these parts for our vessels. I am seeing to their distribution now.

### Crew Member
Commander, as requested we have tracked the delivery of the provided parts. It seems like some ships are clearly being prioritized over others.

### Joanna
Interesting. Could these be the treasure ships the pirates were talking about? We need to find out more.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY07_T4_END
### Crew Member
Commander, we have a direct communication from the Cangacian pirates.

### Catequil
You continue to meddle in affairs that are none of your business! I will have my treasure, and you will stop foiling my plans!

### Joanna
Treasure? What treasure could be aboard these civilian ships? Have you no conscience terrorizing the innocent?

### Catequil
Innocent? You Hiigarans are so naive with your trust it's offensive. If you stand in my way again, I will crush you along with these charlatans you defend!

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY08_T4_END
### Chocoan Coatl
You gift us with your compassion, commander. Most would not go out of their way to defend a stranger.
