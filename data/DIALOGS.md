**qm_t0_introStation_end_1**
Greetings commander, I am Ekekko, a... merchant of the Iyatequa. I would like to seek passage aboard your vessel. In exchange for this transport, I can be your bargain hunter and local guide to this region. I take up little room, and in exchange I can open doors for you that would be closed otherwise.

### NavyCommand:Fleet Command
**qm_t0_introStation_end_2**
Commander, the Iyatequa traders have a lot of local contacts in the vicinity. Access to what they know might be useful in the future. I’ve reviewed his proposal and it’s little effort to allow him and his cargo passage onboard. Security has already vetted his entry.

### NavyCommand:Fleet Command
**qm_t0_introStation_end_3**
Well and met Commander, I am pleased to make your acquaintance and share your voyage. Please come by to visit my on-ship store to <color=#FBB03F>collect your first payment</color> now. In the future you may return any time to collect your daily fee. You are my first customer.

### NavyCommand:Fleet Command
**qm_t0_introMarket_end_dia_3**
We would like to welcome you aboard to bring you up to speed about the situation here in the Nimbus galaxy, but we could use some help securing the local area.

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_introMarket_end_dia_4**
Acknowledged, Lazarus base. Commander, first we should re-equip our forces and <color=#FBB03F>build an interceptor squadron</color>. Our forces were thinned in the battle.

## QM_T0_INTROFABRICATOR_END

### Joanna:Joanna

### NavyCommand:Fleet Command
**qm_t0_introSignals_end_dia_2**
Scouts have already identified this system as being rich in the resources we need. It would help us if you could <color=#FBB03F>mine some ores</color> here and return them to us.

## QM_T0_V2_INTROSCANNING_0_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_v2_introScanning_0_end_dia_1**
We've detected a hostile signature within the system. We need to <color=#FBB03F>analyze the signal</color> to gather more information.

## QM_T0_V2_INTROSCANNING_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_v2_introScanning_end_dia_1**
Analysis of the signature completed. The location and additional information is tracked in our computers. <color=#FBB03F>Jump to the signal</color> to engage the enemies.

## QM_T0_V2_INTROSIGNALS_0_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_v2_introSignals_0_end_dia_1**

## QM_T0_INTROSCANBELTS_0_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_introScanBelts_0_end_dia_1**
There are several potential mining sites, but the signatures are scattered. We'll we need to <color=#FBB03F>analyze the asteroid clusters</color> before we can initiate mining operations.

## QM_T0_INTROSCANBELTS_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_introScanBelts_end_dia_1**
Commander, we have located several mineral-rich asteroids. We can now <color=#FBB03F>jump to the cluster and use our resource collector to mine ores.</color>

## QM_T0_INTROMINING_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_introMining_end_dia_1**
That's it, we now should have enough ore. We should return and <color=#FBB03F>deliver the minerals to Lazarus Station</color>.

## QM_T0_SUPPORT_END

### NavyCommand:Fleet Command
**qm_t0_support_end_dia_1**
Resources received Commander, thank you. We have aboard Gideon S’jet, renowned Progenitor Expert and survivor of the original Caral expedition. He wishes to speak with you.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_support_end_dia_2**
Commander, I am Gideon S’jet. I helped design the Progenitor Communicator you have aboard your vessel. I must assist your mission to explore Progenitor sites.

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_support_end_dia_3**
Gideon was the foremost expert in Progenitor sciences after Karan when he disappeared with the Caral expedition. His knowledge would be invaluable. We should <color=#FBB03F>assign Gideon S'jet to the bridge</color>.

## QM_T0_INTROBRIDGE_END

### NavyCommand:Fleet Command
**qm_t0_introBridge_end_dia_1**
While assigned to the bridge, Gideon grants your flagship another combat skill, which can be activated during battle.

### NavyCommand:Fleet Command
**qm_t0_introBridge_end_dia_2**
Skills require energy to activate. While it will regenerate over time, you cannot activate any skills if your energy reserves are depleted. Choose wisely when and which skills to use.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_introBridge_end_dia_3**
Thank you commander. I shall relocate myself and my team to your vessel. I advise you to build up your fleet, Progenitor ruins are not to be taken lightly.

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_introBridge_end_dia_4**
Dangerous is an understatement. Lazarus Base has offered the use of their shipyards, we should take advantage of this and <color=#FBB03F>build an assault frigate</color>.

## QM_T0_INTROSHIPYARD_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_introShipyard_end_dia_1**
The shipyard construction has finished. We need to <color=#FBB03F>ready our new frigate using the Fleet Configuration</color>.

## QM_T0_INTROEQUIPESCORTS_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_introEquipEscorts_end_dia_1**
Commander, I have studied the after-action report of Wiracoda Gate. Something has changed among the Progenitor ruins in this galaxy, but I require more data before I can begin a useful analysis.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_introEquipEscorts_end_dia_2**
I have colleagues in the local vicinity which may have more information than I have available. We should visit Baaekh S'jet first. I have sent the coordinates of her research lab to your navigation database.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_A_0_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_scientist_Baaekh_A_0_end_dia_1**
Commander, Baaekh S’jet is reported missing. She went on an expedition to the Saaret system and hasn't returned.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_A_1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_scientist_Baaekh_A_1_end_dia_1**
There’s no sign of Baaekh. We should start scanning the area for her. Maybe she's located somewhere inside the extensive asteroid belt of this system.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_A_2_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**qm_t0_scientist_Baaekh_A_2_end_dia_1**
Commander, this is Baaekh S’jet. I am being hunted by hostile craft. Please take care of them, I cannot help you until then.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_A_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_scientist_Baaekh_A_end_dia_1**
We have located the hostile forces that have Baaekh S'jet pinned down. We'll engage them at your order, Commander.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_B_0_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**qm_t0_scientist_Baaekh_B_0_end_dia_1**
Thank you commander. I had no means of escape without your assistance. I can provide you the data you seek if you return me to the research station in Iniim.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_BAAEKH_B_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**qm_t0_scientist_Baaekh_B_end_dia_1**
Thank you for returning me safely. Here is your data. We found coordinates to a progenitor ruin which might be useful for you.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_scientist_Baaekh_B_end_dia_2**
Thank you. Commander, I have sent the coordinates of the ruin into the navigation database.

## QM_T0_RELIC_0_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_relic_0_end_dia_1**
Commander, we must scan this system to locate the relic's signature.

## QM_T0_RELIC_1_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**qm_t0_relic_1_end_dia_1**
Relic signature detected. Coordinates locked. We'll investigate on your command.

## QM_T0_RELIC_2_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_relic_2_end_dia_1**
The relic has yielded some interesting information, but unfortunately no answers. I will send the coordinates to my second colleague into the navigation database.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_HYEAA_A_0_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**qm_t0_scientist_Hyeaa_A_0_end_dia_1**
Commander, Gideon has informed me you are seeking information. I am willing to help, but we are currently running low on resources. What do you say, you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours?

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_HYEAA_A_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**qm_t0_scientist_Hyeaa_A_end_dia_1**
Yes, this will do. I am transmitting my research data as we speak.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_scientist_Hyeaa_A_end_dia_2**
Commander, this looks very promising. With this data I have traced a progenitor command signal back to Toasiim. We should find a Progenitor Relic generating this signal there.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_HYEAA_B_0_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**qm_t0_scientist_Hyeaa_B_0_end_dia_1**
I see the rapid construction techniques have scantly improved in my absence, save for materials allocation and allotment. How little we’ve improved over even the past century.

## QM_T0_SCIENTIST_HYEAA_B_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**qm_t0_scientist_Hyeaa_B_end_dia_1**
Thank you commander. I am giving you my conclusions based on my studies here of Progenitor manufacturing. There are some techniques you may find useful for future modifications.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_scientist_Hyeaa_B_end_dia_2**
Commander, I have traced a progenitor command signal back to Toasiim. We should find a Progenitor Relic generating this signal there.

## QM_T0_JOLJA_0_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_Jolja_0_end_dia_1**
The progenitor terminal must be somewhere in this system. We should perform some scans to find it.

## QM_T0_JOLJA_1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_Jolja_1_end_dia_1**
We're picking up the right signature. We're on the right track. I locked in the coordinates. We should go there and find it.

## QM_T0_JOLJA_END

### NavyCommand:Fleet Command
**qm_t0_Jolja_end_dia_1**
Commander, your star is rising among our people, and we wish to know <color=#FBB03F>what Kiith you declare allegiance for</color>. Declaring for a Kiith will bring other survivors of that Kiith to your fleet, along with their gifts.

## QM_T0_PICKKIITH_END

### NavyCommand:Fleet Command
**qm_t0_pickKiith_end_dia_1**
Excellent. The old structures are still strong, but new systems are beginning to emerge. Maybe you want to join a clan as well.

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_pickKiith_end_dia_2**
Commander, while you are listed as the ship's captain, Admiral Enoch is still considered our commanding officer, which...

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t0_pickKiith_end_dia_3**
What I'm trying to say is that you should <color=#FBB03F>register your name</color> in the admiralty board computer. Then you will be officially recognized as our leading flag officer.

## QM_T0_PICKNAME_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**qm_t0_pickName_end_dia_1**
We have completed upgrades to the hyperspace module. With greater power we can overcome the strange gravity anomalies that litter this galaxy.

## QM_T3_GASMINING_0_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t3_gasMining_0_end_dia_1**
Now that we have built a gas collector, we can send it into jovians to harvest useful gases.

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t3_gasMining_0_end_dia_2**
To do so, simply move it into the outer atmospheric layer of a gas planet. It will start collection automatically.

### Joanna:Joanna
**qm_t3_gasMining_0_end_dia_3**
But we need to be careful. Deeper layers will deal more <color=#FBB03F>damage</color> to our craft. Don't send it in too deep!

Commander, Plasma Bombers are very effective against armored tagets. Use them to attack the Decommissioned Frigates.

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_pool_tutRange_1_dialog**
Sensors have determined these kinetic batteries have inferior tracking equipment. Their range is limited as a result.

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_pool_tutRange_2_dialog**

## S_POOL_TUTFALLOFF_1_DIALOG

Interesting.. Theres a Progenitor structure here. Function is unknown. Tanoch maps identify this as Temple Tonaati.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_movetoStation_2**
We should begin our investigation there. However, it seems the temple is heavily patrolled by the Tanoch temple forces. They probably won't admit us.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_movetoStation_3**
Their defenses are formidable, and we don't want to commit sacrilage by attacking a Holy Site.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_movetoStation_3a**
Solar activity is significant beyond the station, It's too risky to travel there.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_movetoStation_4**
However, there are two debris field passages we can use to stay safe through the Solar radiation.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_movetoStation_5**
One is to the left, the other is to the right.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_movetoStation_6**
We cannot scan the debris fields from this distance, but it is a good guess there may be Progenitor devices active in this debris. Its still safer than turning the Temple's defenses against us.

## STORY-03-02-V2_CIVILSTATION_REACHED_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_civilStation_reached_1**
Many ships are headed to the temple, likely carrying pilgrims to worship the star.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_civilStation_reached_2**
We've scanned Temple Tonaati. There are no Vaygr ships or transmissions here.

## STORY-03-02-V2_EXPLAINSTAR_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_explainStar_1**
This is interesting... the Temple has a built in field generator, creating a magnetic funnel.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_explainStar_2**
Not only can we use it to get close to the star through hyperspace, but it will bring us to a specific destination. We won't know until we use it.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_explainStar_3**
The Vaygr aren't here now, but they may have passed through this area recently.

## STORY-03-02-V2_YAOTSUDDENLY_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_yaotsuddenly_1**
Commander, a large cluster of craft have just emerged from Hyperspace. It's... a Yaot attack force.

### Guahai:Guahai
**st_3_2_v2_yaotsuddenly_2**
Attention, Tanoch Defenders. I am Guahai, Zaque of the Yaot Federation. Surrender yourselves, or be destroyed.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_yaotsuddenly_3**
This is a civilian installation! The defenses here are too small to fend off an entire attack force!

### Guahai:Guahai
**st_3_2_v2_yaotsuddenly_4**
Do not doubt that we will do what is necessary in the shadow of your holy place. Surrender! We are the stronger here!

## STORY-03-02-V2_YAOTATTACK_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_yaotattack_1**
The Yaot fleet is too massive for us to even hope to stop. Even if we were to join forces with the temple defenders.

## STORY-03-02-V2_TEMPLE_KILLED_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_temple_killed_1**
I... commander, the defenses have been destroyed by unknown means. They must have tremendous firepower at their disposal!

### Chaquen:Chaquen
**st_3_2_v2_temple_killed_2**
I am Chaquen, a Commander in the Yaot Federation.

### Chaquen:Chaquen
**st_3_2_v2_temple_killed_3**
Hiigarans, you are known to us. I say to you now: abandon these people. You are not involved in this war. Save yourselves. Leave before it is too late.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_temple_killed_4**
Commander, we can't sit by and leave these people to their fate. We must defend the installation.

## STORY-03-02-V2_BOSS_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_boss_1**
The Yaot are sending another probing force towards us. Prepare for contact!

## STORY-03-02-V2_FINISH_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_finish_1**
It seems the Yaot are pulling away from the area. Odd... a force-size like that, they should have destroyed us easily.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_finish_2**
Commander... the field generator is disabled. The funnel is gone. The Tanoch must have destroyed it rather than let the Yaot gain possession of it.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_finish_3**
The Yaot must know this also, they've left the area. However, we still have the travel vector and coordinates targeted by the funnel. That should be our next destination.

## STORY-03-02-V2_MISSIONFAIL_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_3_2_v2_missionfail_1**
The station is gone... so many lives lost. We must escape before the Yaot finish us off as well!

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_1_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_intro_1_1**
Hyperspace jump successful.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_intro_1_2**
We are in orbit over what the Tanoch call Star Totek: Their Holy star.

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_2_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_intro_2_1**
Totek is highly unusual. Outside temperatures are only a fraction of what we would expect for a star of this size.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_intro_2_2**
Though the star has central religious significance to the Tanoch, very little scientific data is publicly known about it.

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_3_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_intro_3_1**
Comms are still detecting significant Vaygr signal traffic in the area. They seem to be emanating from here.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_intro_3_2**
We need to discover what the Vaygr are doing here, and get a better estimation of their forces.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_intro_3_3**
The presence of a Progenitor debris ring is unusual, but we can use this to get closer to the signal point. Use the debris to shield our ships from the heat of the star.

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_4_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_intro_4_1**
Fleet Intelligence suggests this is the safest route through the debris to the target area.

## ST_STARTOTEK_INTRO_5_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_intro_5_1**
There is an area where we can risk damage to flank the Vaygr, if they're there. They won't expect us coming from this vector.

## ST_STARTOTEK_DEBRI_1_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_debri_1_1**
We must navigate the debris. Although Totek is a colder star, direct exposure to the corona will damage our ships. The debris will shield us.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_debri_1_2**
The heat is intense enough to rapidly destroy our strike craft, which lack the armor to survive the corona's intensity.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_debri_1_3**
Recommend docking our strike craft and harvesters until we are in a safer area.

## ST_STARTOTEK_DEBRI_2_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_debri_2_1**
Warning! We are no longer shielded from the sun. The fleet is taking damage!

## ST_STARTOTEK_DEBRI_3_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_debri_3_1**
Initiating Emergency hyperspace! Commander, we have to clear the range of the sun and repair the fleet before we can continue.

## ST_STARTOTEK_SENTI_1_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_senti_1_1**
Attack drones detected. Be careful maneuvering here, don't let the drones draw you out into the sun.

## ST_STARTOTEK_SENTI_2_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_senti_2_1**
If we go to the signal point from here, we'll be catching them by complete surprise. Do you wish to cross here?

## ST_STARTOTEK_SENTI_3_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_senti_3_1**
If we cross here to the signal point, we'll catch anyone out of position. Shall we cross here?

## ST_STARTOTEK_SENTI_4_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_senti_4_1**
More attack drones. Keep the fleet together Commander, don't let them draw us into the sunlight!

## ST_STARTOTEK_VAYGR_1_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_vaygr_1_1**
We're closing on the location of the Vaygr signal.

## ST_STARTOTEK_VAYGR_2_DIALOG

### VaygrGeneric:Vaygr Commander
**st_startotek_vaygr_2_1**
My lord, the Hiigarans are here.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_vaygr_2_2**
Excellent, and very timely. They did not disappoint.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_vaygr_2_3**
Hiigarans, I extend you a formal welcome to the Nimbus Galaxy.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_vaygr_2_4**
Of course, I cannot let you interrupt my plans. Since I know it is already useless to ask for your surrender, instead, I'll bid you to die well.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_vaygr_2_5**
Destroy them.

## ST_STARTOTEK_BATTLE_1_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_battle_1_1**
The Vaygr are attacking. We need to push past them to see what they are planning!

## ST_STARTOTEK_BATTLE_2_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_battle_2_1**
Vaygr reinforcements coming out of Hyperspace!

## ST_STARTOTEK_SALVA_1_DIALOG

### VaygrGeneric:Vaygr Commander
**st_startotek_salva_1_1**
The nodule is loaded and secured, my lord.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_salva_1_2**
Excellent.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_salva_1_3**
We are finished here, Hiigarans. I will depart now.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_salva_1_5**
But I leave you with one bit of advice, and a warning.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_salva_1_6**
Do not rest to your assumptions. All can change in an instant.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_salva_1_7**
And you have much to learn about the extent of the Progenitor's Legacy.

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**st_startotek_salva_1_8**
Farewell.

## ST_STARTOTEK_SALVA_2_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_salva_2_1**
He's taunting us. This raises even more questions about what the Vaygr intend to do in Nimbus.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_salva_2_1_1**
For now lets focus on surviving the moment!

## ST_STARTOTEK_SALVA_3_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_salva_2_2**
Based on sensor analysis, this object is a power transmission nodule. It collects energy from the star to beam to distant targets.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_salva_2_3**
There are literally thousands of these arrays in orbit around Totek. It seems Jochik was salvaging a component from them... but we don't know what it is.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_startotek_salva_2_4**
We won't find more answers here. We need to continue investigating local systems and inquire among the Tanoch.

## ST_FARSHORE_INTRO_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_intro_jo_1**
We've arrived at the location of the Khar-Kalaad's distress signal.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_intro_jo_2**
I've marked the Khar-Kalaad's exact position on the Sensor's manager. We should investigate.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_intro_jo_3**
We have no response to outgoing signals, so either Vice Admiral Vashti is keeping a low profile, or it's a trap. Proceed with caution.

## ST_FARSHORE_ALLY_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_ally_jo_1**
Sensors confirm, it's the Khar-Kalaad.

### Vashti:Vashti
**st_farshore_ally_va_1**
Greetings Commander, it has been a long time.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_ally_jo_2**
Vice Admiral! It's good to see you alive! We lost all contact after the battle at Wiracoda Gate.

### Vashti:Vashti
**st_farshore_ally_va_2**
We were forced to conduct major repairs after that battle. We maintained a low profile afterward, in order to avoid attracting attention.

### Vashti:Vashti
**st_farshore_ally_va_3**
By then you had already gotten the attention of the local powers. While you forged ahead we gathered more information about the Progenitors of this galaxy. This lead us here.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_ally_jo_3**
We've had dubious luck using it in the past. Are you sure it's wise to try it?

### Vashti:Vashti
**st_farshore_ally_va_6**
It's our best chance to access this data. Consider it an order from a superior officer of Task Force Ararat.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_ally_jo_4**
We could use that data, and the Vice Admiral is still technically our commander.

## ST_FARSHORE_START_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_start_jo_1**
In order to establish a connection we'll need to dock a resource controller with the Lighthouse. Target is designated.

## ST_FARSHORE_HODOR_1_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_hodor_jo_1**
Our salvage team has docked with the Lighthouse. They're connecting with the Khar-Kalaad's team now.

### Vashti:Vashti
**st_farshore_hodor_va_1**
Commander, we have incoming hyperspace signatures at distance.

### TanochGeneric:Tanoch Commander
**st_farshore_hodor_tan_1**
Intruders, this site is holy. Surrender your vessels and prepare to be boarded.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_hodor_jo_3**
These are Tanoch Temple guardians. We must have offended some Tanoch religious taboo by coming here.

## ST_FARSHORE_HODOR_2_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_hodor_jo_4**
Engineering, what's your status?

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**st_farshore_hodor_eng_1**
Connection is being completed now, command. Cryptography is trying to input signal.

### Joanna:Joanna

We don't have much time. Another wave is incoming.

## ST_FARSHORE_HODOR_3_DIALOG

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**st_farshore_hodor_eng_2**
Commander, Cryptography reports there's no cartographic data here.

### Vashti:Vashti
**st_farshore_hodor_va_2**
Are you certain?

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**st_farshore_hodor_eng_3**
Yes Vice Admiral. We're continuing to investigate.

## ST_FARSHORE_HODOR_4_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_hodor_jo_6**
We can't take much more of this.

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**st_farshore_hodor_eng_4**
Command, this tower is a navigational aid. It's used to cross the nearby unstable nebula to reach the other side.

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_hodor_jo_7**
A tightrope into the maelstrom?

## ST_FARSHORE_EYE_1_DIALOG

### Vashti:Vashti
**st_farshore_eye_va_1**
More ships are approaching through hyperspace. We cannot delay, any longer and we won't be able to escape safely.

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**st_farshore_eye_eng_1**
We're close to gaining navigational data to guide us to the other end of the bridge network. We need more time!

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_eye_jo_1**
Commander... something... odd is happening right above us!

## ST_FARSHORE_EYE_2_DIALOG

### Vashti:Vashti
**st_farshore_eye_va_2**
What is that?

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_farshore_eye_jo_2**
There's no corresponding craft of this type in our database on the Progenitors.

Our engines aren't powerful enough to pursue the Progenitor object.

## ST_FARSHORE_ESC_2_DIALOG

We have its destination vector. When we have a powerful enough engine, we can pursue.

Hyperspace jump completed. Looks like the lighthouse guided us successfully through the maelstrom.

### Vashti:Vashti

No sign of any recent activity here. This region of space is uncharted to everyone we've met so far in Nimbus.

## ST_ILIYIN_INTRO_2_DIALOG

Commander, translation is up. We have a workable dictionary to communicate with.

### Vashti:Vashti

**s_hataldan_abduction3_1**
That's not my problem, Vice Admiral. I'm sure you Kiithid will figure it out. Meanwhile, I have a job to do. Fleet, hyperspace in five!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPTUT

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_hataldan_empTut_1**
The Observer was the only thing keeping the Keepers from attacking. We can't let them destroy the Amassari!

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_hataldan_empTut_2**
Commander, my ship is equipped with an EMP weapon designed to disrupt the Keepers. We completed it after Wiracoda.

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_hataldan_empTut_3**
We can stun the Keepers for a short time and render them vulnerable. We only have 3 charges, make them count!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_FIGHT

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_hataldan_fight_1**
The keepers are here. Avoid contact until the EMP is ready. First charge energizing now.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPFIRED_1

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_hataldan_empFired_1**
First EMP fired. The Keepers are stunned, it worked! Inflict as much damage as possible!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPFIRED_2

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_hataldan_empFired_2**
Second EMP fired. Keepers are shutting down. All ships engage!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPFIRED_3

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_hataldan_empFired_3**
Third EMP fired. This is our final chance to destroy the keepers, hold back nothing!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPOFF_1

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_hataldan_empOff_1**
The Keepers are showing signs of reactivation! Prepare for incoming fire until the second charge is energized.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_EMPOFF_2

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_hataldan_empOff_2**
The Keepers are reactivating! Expect the attacks to resume any moment.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_FIGHTWON

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_hataldan_fightWon_1**
The final keeper is destroyed, area cleared! We did it!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_CONCLUSION

### amassari_01:Amassari
**s_hataldan_conclusion_1**
Hiigarans, I am Elder Kotlan of the Lyad. Your bravery does not go amiss, but neither does the behavior of your ally. What are your intentions?

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_hataldan_conclusion_2**
We were betrayed by one of our own. On our honor as exiles, we will free the Observer and punish its captor.

### amassari_01:Amassari
**s_hataldan_conclusion_3**
If you do this on behalf of the Makers, your name will be spoken and remembered by all Amassari. Good fortune to you.

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_FAILKILL

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_hataldan_failKill_1**
The keepers are calling to other Progenitor automations, we must leave immediately. Initate emergency hyperspace jump!

**s_hataldan_failKharKalaad_1**
Commander, the Khar-Kaalad has been hit! We must withdraw!

## S_HATALDAN_DIALOG_FAILAMASSARI

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_hataldan_failAmassari_1**
Commander, we failed to defend the Amassari ships. Critical mission failure!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_INTROA

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_introA_1**
Hyperspace jump complete. The Nightmare Gulf is still disrupting sensors. We would never have found this place without the Hagthar.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_INTROB

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_introB_1**
The Kiithless have built a stronghold in the nebula. There are heavy defenses. This must be Kidara's main base.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_INTROC

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_introC_1**
The Observer is here. It is being chained by EMP-beams of custom design. We must destroy these platforms to set the Observer free.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_ENGAGE

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_engage_1**
Kidara doesn't seem to be here, but I wouldn't rule out an ambush. Begin the attack!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWNA

### Kidara:Kidara
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnA_1**
I knew you arrogant Kiithid couldn't resist one last attempt to stop our plans. It will not matter. I will crush the Amassari and bring glory to Hiigara.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWNB

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnB_1**
Your recklessness will kill us all! You can't just brute force your way to enlightenment, Kidara! The works of the Progenitors still contain many dangers!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWNC

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnC_1**
Kidara, please see reason! This path to power is the path to ruin! It destroyed the ancient Hiigarans! It destroyed the Hagthar!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWND

### Kidara:Kidara
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnD_1**
Lies and cowardice. The secrets of the Progenitors are ours. If you will not join me, then die and be forgotten as you should have been on Kharak!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_KIDARASPAWNE

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_kidaraSpawnE_1**
It's either Kidara's way or ours. We must stop her!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_EMP

**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_emp_1**
Witness the power I command!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_TORPEDO

The Observer awakens. Now we shall end this conflict, together.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_STATION

### Kidara:Kidara
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_station_1**
You may destroy my station, but I will fight to the last!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_FAILKHARKALAAD

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_failKharKalaad_1**
Commander, the Khar-Kaalad has been hit! We must withdraw!

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_WIN

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_win_1**
Even to the end, Kidara couldn't allow others to win. The zeal of these Kiithless is disturbing.

### Vashti:Vashti
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_win_2**
She could have been so much more if she just set aside her pride for the sake of others. Now she's gone, along with all who followed her.

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_win_3**
What matters is that the Observer is freed. The Amassari are coming in. They're celebrating.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_OBSERVERA

### Observer:Observer
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_observerA_1**
Children of Hiigara. Continuity resumes. What was unbalanced is now steadied. The path resumes its shape.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_OBSERVERB

### Observer:Observer
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_observerB_1**
The road of the ancients is fractured. All paths to Archara are blocked by ancient order. Only one road remains that will lead you home.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_OBSERVERC

### Observer:Observer
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_observerC_1**
All paths converge at Ya' Axtche. Begin your quest at the Five Watchers. All other paths you find will fail.

## S_NIGHTMAREGULF_DIALOG_END

### amassari_01:Amassari
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_end_1**
What you have done today is worthy of tales and legends, you have returned the Observer to us. Our thanks to you is without end.

### Joanna:Joanna
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_end_2**
We had to make our transgression right. But we have to ask, what is Ya' Axtche? What did the Observer mean?

### amassari_01:Amassari
**s_nightmareGulf_dialog_end_3**
It is an ancient word, one of our oldest, from before the days of our ancestors. Ya' Axtche is the World Tree, the beating heart of the universe.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_INTRO

### HiigaranGeneric:Hiigaran Commander

### HiigaranGeneric:Hiigaran Commander
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_wave1A_1**
Cangacians incoming! They are coming for the bounty on my head. The Iyatequa don't want the information I have getting out.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_WAVE1B

### HiigaranGeneric:Hiigaran Commander
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_wave1B_1**
Attention, a new wave has come out of hyperspace behind us.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_MINES

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_mines_1**
Commander, we've detected a mine field ahead. We must clear the path to give Captain Mahel a straight shot to the station.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_WAVE2

### HiigaranGeneric:Hiigaran Commander
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_wave2_1**
Commander, another wave has appeared. The bounty must be huge to send a fleet this big just for me.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_COUNTDOWN

### HiigaranGeneric:Hiigaran Commander
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_countdown_1**
I've docked. My crew has hooked up the transmitter... sending now.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_WAVE3

### Joanna:Joanna

More ships have emerged from Hyperspace. The Iyatequa really want this information burried.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_KILLALL

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_killAll_1**
Looks like the Cangaicans ran out of ships. All hostiles destroyed, proceed on mission.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_WIN

### HiigaranGeneric:Hiigaran Commander
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_win_1**
Transmission to Lazarus base completed. It's done, the word is out.

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_win_2**
The Cangacians are retreating. What information did you have?

### HiigaranGeneric:Hiigaran Commander
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_win_3**
The Iyatequa have been selling our Progenitor control codes.

### HiigaranGeneric:Hiigaran Commander
**e_iyaFall2023_escort_win_4**
If the powers here can command Progenitor units like we used to, it's going to be disasterous for the balance of power in this area.

## E_IYAFALL2023_ESCORT_DIALOG_ALLYLOW

### HiigaranGeneric:Hiigaran Commander

Commander, our ship is in danger! Please assist!

Wiracoda Gate. I never imagined we'd return so soon. We were so optimistic when we first arrived here...

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_intro_2**
Time is of the essence. The Freighter containing the Negotiator must be a specific distance to the gate in order to activate. Move quickly, Commander!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_GO

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_go_1**
Admiral Enoch perished here ordering us to return home. We would honor his wishes by completing his final command.

The Freighter is in position. Standby, we are beginning system interlinks.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_PROGINCOMING

Progenitor defenses are reacting to our presence. Hold them off, don't yield this time!

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_progIncoming_2**
Defend the Negotiator at all cost. We cannot lose it. It's our only chance to return home.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_PROGRETREATING

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_progRetreating_1**
Commander, the Progenitors are relenting... they're becoming passive to our presence.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_CONTROL

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_control_1**
The Negotiator is working. A little longer and we will regain control of the gate... and our route home.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_CATEINCOMING

**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_cateIncoming_1**

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_CATERETREATING

### Catequil:Catequil
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_cateRetreating_1**
The accursed Hiigarans have angered the Makers. We'll leave them to their fate. All ships retreat!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_STANDGROUND

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_standGround_1**
The cowards are fleeing. We must stand our ground. We might be able to retrieve the Negotiator's parts!

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_REGENERATION

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_regeneration_1**
Commander, the Keeper has just self-repaired! This ability is nothing I've seen before.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_ESCAPE

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_escape_1**
Commander, we cannot win this fight. As long as this Keeper regenerates itself, we don't stand a chance. I'm afraid we must flee the gate once again.

## E_ANNIVERSARY2023_WIRACODA_DEVICEKILLED

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_anniversary2023_Wiracoda_deviceKilled_1**
Commander, the Progenitor Negotiator was destroyed. We failed the special operation. We must retreat immediately!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_INTRO

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_intro_1**
Hyperspace jump completed. Is this another gate? It's not on any known charts. We're not reading the errant Keeper on sensors.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_intro_2**
These two corrupted derelicts emanate enormous energy. They must be the source of the Keeper's abnormal powers. We have to destroy them!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_COMBAT

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_combat_1**
Commander, as long as the Keeper is energized, it will have the ability to self-repair. Avoid it for now and focus on destroying the derelicts!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_OUTRO

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_outro_1**
We did it! The Keeper is eliminated. The malignant command signal has ceased. The Progenitors will halt their active phase at once.

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_outro_2**
Excellent work, Commander. You put a stop to the Progenitor incursion. You saved the galaxy.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_outro_3**
We ended what we began by accident, but the door back home remains closed. We cannot give up on this quest. There will come another day.

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKSEE

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_malikRegenA_1**
The keeper is regenerating itself. It is pointless to attack it for now. Focus on the derelicts!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKREGENB

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_malikRegenB_1**
The keeper is still regenerating itself. It is pointless to attack it for now. Focus on the derelicts!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_MALIKWEAKENED

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_malikWeakened_1**
Commander, the Keeper is taking more damage than before. It's self-repair ability is weakening! Destroy the last derelict!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_DERELICTWAVE

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_derelictWave_1**
Commander, the derelict is spawning a wave of hostile units!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_DERELICTDOWNA

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_derelictDownA_1**
The first derelict is destroyed. The energy field is weakening, but we must destroy the other one as well!

## E_HALLOWEEN2023_RASHIDUN_DERELICTDOWNB

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**e_halloween2023_Rashidun_derelictDownB_1**
All derelicts neutralized. We did it! The energy field is dissipating. The Keeper is vulnerable now!

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_INTRO

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_intro_1**
Hyperspace jump completed. There's no sign of the raiders yet, we should take defensive positions.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_intro_2**
We're fortunate to make it in time. Today my people will be protected and we may learn more about our attackers as well.

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_FIRSTWAVE

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_firstWave_1**
There they are. Hostile units are on approach vectors. Prepare for contact!

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_NEXTWAVE

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_nextWave_1**
Commander, another wave is approaching!

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_WIN

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_win_1**
The raid has failed, we've held the line. Salvage teams are already scanning the debris for anything of interest from the attacking ships.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_win_2**
Commander, these vessels belong to the Tecuban. But why would they carry out raids against us? They've never been this desperate.

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_win_3**
What are the Tecuban? Are they a people like the Chicuat, subjects of the Empire?

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_win_4**
Yes. Like us, they are a people who live within the Empire. But they have never been openly hostile to us or any other. Perhaps they are taking advantage of the recent chaos?

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_win_5**
Commander, we can't repel these raids forever. Like it or not, we'll need to get more involved in this internal dispute within the Empire.

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_STATIONLOW

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_stationLow_1**
Commander, our station can't withstand much more of this. My people are dying, do something!

## E_TANWIN2023_DEFENDBASE_FAIL

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_DefendBase_fail_1**
Commander, the station just disintegrated. We've failed... we must withdraw.

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_INTRO

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_intro_1**
We've found the base. It's active with many hostiles in the area. We're outnumbered, but if we engage carefully we can maximize the element of surprise.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_intro_2**
This base is larger than I expected, which is troubling. Wipe it from this system to send a message. These raids will no longer be tolerated!

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_ALERT

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_alert_1**
Commander, we're being illuminated by active targeting. Hostile craft approaching.

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_WAVE

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_wave_1**
More enemy craft emerging from hyperspace.

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_BOSS

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_boss_1**
More enemies... strange... are that Vaygr craft? What are they doing here?

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_VAYGR

### VaygrGeneric:Vaygr Commander
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_vaygr_1**
Hiigarans! Eliminate them immediately, there must be no witnesses!

## E_TANWIN2023_ATTACKBASE_WIN

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_win_1**
All threats neutralized. There was no sign of Heyoka, but the Vaygr appearing here raises a lot of questions.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_win_2**
Who are these Vaygr? I have heard of the name, but nothing more.

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_win_3**
The Vaygr are enemies of ours from a war almost two decades ago. Somehow they're here in Nimbus too.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_win_4**
So the Tecuban have allied with these Vaygr to pillage my people? This... this is worse than I imagined.

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_AttackBase_win_5**
You have powerful allies now as well. If the Vaygr are involved, this is our fight too. Together we'll get to the bottom of this.

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_INTRO

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_Relic_intro_1**
Commander, the Vaygr are ahead. They appear to be patrolling a Progenitor artifact.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_Relic_intro_2**
Why are these Vaygr interested in objects from the Makers?

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_Relic_intro_3**
To fulfill an ancient prophecy, originally. Like us the Vaygr understand how to use these ancient devices.

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_CONTACT

### VaygrGeneric:Vaygr Commander

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_BOSS_LOW

### VaygrGeneric:Vaygr Commander
**e_tanWin2023_Relic_boss_low_1**
Curse you, Hiigarans! You will never spoil the plans of Jochik Kaan, heir to the rightful Saju-ka!

## E_TANWIN2023_RELIC_WIN

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_Relic_win_1**
All hostiles defeated. So Jochik Kaan is pulling the strings in this conflict. He must have some deeper plan here for the Vaygr to be this involved.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_Relic_win_2**
Yet another ruthless leader behind the attacks upon my people? It is not enough for the Tecuban to turn against us?

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_Relic_win_3**
We must discover what Jochik Kaan is trying to achieve here. Once we do, we'll put a stop to it.

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_HEYOKA

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_heyoka_1**
You've obstructed my plans for the last time, Heyoka! I have no use for disobedient fools!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_SITUATION

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_situation_1**
The Vaygr are attacking the Tecuban? What is happening?

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_HIIGARANS

### VaygrGeneric:Vaygr Commander
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_hiigarans_1**
My lord, the Hiigarans have arrived. They are approaching for battle.

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_COMBAT

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_combat_1**
All my enemies have gathered... no matter. We will crush them all and take what we came for.

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_ACADEMYLOW

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_academyLow_1**
The Academy is under attack! Commander, do something!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_FAILACADEMY

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_failAcademy_1**
The Academy has fallen... we can't stop Jochik. All ships, retreat immediately!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_JOCHIKDOWNA

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_jochikDownA_1**
Reposition the flagship. Deploy the reserves. Destroy the Hiigarans!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_JOCHIKDOWNB

### JochickKaan:Jochik Kaan
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_jochikDownB_1**
Savor your insignificant victory today, Hiigarans! I will crush you the next time we meet. Consider that a promise.

Tepin Papan's vessel was destroyed. We can't stop Jochik. All ships, retreat immediately!

## E_TANWIN2023_ACADEMY_WIN

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_win_1**
The Tlapallan Academy is safe. My people are protected and our enemies are on the run... I can't believe we prevailed.

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_win_2**
The Tecuban have retreated. It seems Heyoka tried to get to the relic before Jochik did, and paid the price.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_win_3**
His greed brought him to pillage the future of my people for his own gratification. I don't mourn his death.

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_win_4**
Our people are safe for now, but the Chicuat need a voice to speak on their behalf among our allies. Toci, you could be that voice among the Hiigarans.

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_tanWin2023_Academy_win_5**
We would be grateful to have you aboard, Toci. Your people are always welcome among us.

### Joanna:Joanna

Chocoan what's going on? You're deviating from the path! We must protect the perimeter.

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_deviation_2**
It must be done. Our ways are... not to be questioned by outsiders. Please, maintain defensive positions.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_ATTACKA

I... please... I can't.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CATEQUIL

### Catequil:Catequil
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_catequil_1**
So we meet again, Hiigarans. You won't stop me this time. I'll have that treasure, even if I have to rip it out of every ship I see! Do not let any of them escape!

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CHANGE

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_change_1**
More hostile incoming. Chocoan, what the hell is going on? We need your help or civilians will die!

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_change_2**
I... I cannot... do this any longer. We are coming to your aid, and to the hells with the Elders and their ambition!

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CATEQUILLOW

**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_win_2**
Under the grace of the Makers, the pilgrims are safe with minimal casualties. Thank you, Commander.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CONJUNCTIONA

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_conjunctionA_1**
The Conjunction is the clearest sign that our Makers were powerful and wise. The messages they left in the alignment of the stars are profound, even if their exact meaning is lost.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_CONJUNCTIONB

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_conjunctionB_1**
Though there are signs and portents of a great change coming, there is hope also in this change. Yes there is uncertainty, but the signs point to a great relief.

## E_YAOSPR2024_CONJUNCTION_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_end_1**
Chocoan, what was going on back there?

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_end_2**
I can only confess. Our Elders pervert these pilgrimages with their own causes and ambitions. We rake the ruins of the Makers, scoop them into our hulls, for some reason.

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_end_3**
They're looking for some Progenitor technology in those asteroids, aren't they?

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_end_4**
It would seem to be so. The Elders will surely take retribution for my failure, so I am without a place for I surely cannot return. I am no longer Envoy, or shephard, of my people.

### Joanna:Joanna
**e_yaoSpr2024_Conjunction_end_5**
You are always welcome among us, Chocoan. The warmth you showed your people could be a great asset to us as an envoy to the Yaot in the future.

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid001_start_2**
But their main fleet is not anywhere on sensors.

## MISS010_G1_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid001_start_3**
We should take this chance and wipe out this base before their fleet returns.

## MISS010_G_BOSS_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid001_boss_1**
The pirate fleet has returned! Let's finish them off!

## RAIDMISSION001_DIALOG_FINISH

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid001_finish_1**
The pirate fleet has been destroyed. Prisoners were collected among the survivors and we're collecting salvage.

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid001_finish_2**
Great work! I think the locals will appreciate the one less pirate base in the area.

## RAIDMISSION002_START_DIALOG

It looks like we beat the enemy fleet here. We should get into position while we have the time!

## RAIDMISSION002_BEACONS_DIALOG

Three beacons have been destroyed. Almost there.

## RAIDMISSION002_BOSS_DIALOG

Something large has just emerged from hyperspace. It's the main pirate fleet! Defend the station!

## RAIDMISSION002_DIALOG_FINISH

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid002_dialog_finish_1**
The invaders have been repelled. It may take some time to rebuild the nav beacons, but the station should be safe again.

## RAIDMISSION002_DIALOG_FAIL

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid002_dialog_fail_1**
The station is lost. Fortunately most of the inhabitants evacuated during the battle.

## R003_START_DIALOG0

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid003_dialog_start_1**
This base belongs to a group called the Fleet of Rams. It's in a position to threaten any other Hiigaran fleets that arrive in the area.

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid003_dialog_start_2**
Now that we're in contact with enough allied fleets, we can strike this base and wipe it out.

## R003_BASEHP80_DIALOG0

### Joanna:Joanna

The Fleet of Rams is here. Proceed with caution.

Another group of pirates appeared on our flank!

## R003_BASEHP40_DIALOG0

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid003_dialog_hp40_1**
It looks like their flagship just emerged from hyperspace. The enemy commander is identifying himself as... Catequil the devisor. Sounds pretentious.

### Catequil:Catequil
**Raid003_dialog_hp40_2**
Who? Hiigarans? I don't have time for this nuisance. Eliminate them!

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid003_dialog_hp40_3**
Here they come, prepare for a fight!

## R003_FINISH_DIALOG0

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid003_dialog_finish_1**
The enemy base has been destroyed and Catequil is on the run. We did it!

### Catequil:Catequil
**Raid003_dialog_finish_2**
You have my attention now, Hiigarans. You'll regret this on our next meeting!

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid003_dialog_finish_3**
Any other Hiigaran refugees in the area will be in the clear, now. But we'll need to be wary of this Fleet of Rams... I have a feeling they'll be back.

## ST_BREACH_INTRO_1_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**st_breach_intro_1_1**
We've arrived at the target destination. This base is sitting in a crucial defensive position. Escort the freighter filled with explosives to the station to destroy it.

### Joanna:Joanna

Kidara's defeated, the Observer has been freed, and the Kiithless have been routed. All objectives completed... mission successful.

## RAID004_INTRO_DIA

If the Yaot capture this VIP there's no telling what kind of intelligence the Yaot can extract from him. We need to intervene.

## RAID004_KILLCOMMANDS_DIA

### amassari_01:Amassari
**Raid005_Intro_2**
Vessel! We are in need of assistance. Our command ship is stranded beyond the meteor shield. You have to help us, there are civilians onboard!

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid005_Intro_3**
How do we pass through this shield?

### amassari_01:Amassari
**Raid005_Intro_4**
Two pillars generate the meteor shield that keeps the asteroids contained. They will need to be disabled so that you can pass, but the barrier repairs itself quickly. Be warned also, the Kakahl Amassari do not take kindly to interlopers. Please hurry!

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid005_Intro_5**
If we help them they may be able to give us some assistance in this region. We should split up, one command per each base. We'll have to time our assault to drop both bases at the same time to allow entry.

## RAID005_CHALLENGE_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid005_Base_1**
There it is. The structure is Amassari make, a form of Gravity well Generator used to keep asteroids in place. This was probably a holding area for a large mining operation. We're being contacted.

### Amassari_Evil:Amassari_Evil - speaker name not found
**Raid005_Base_2**
We do not welcome strangers on our mining grounds! Begone! or be destroyed!

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid005_Base_3**
We need to rescue the command ship trapped within the field. If you can drop the barrier to rescue the ship, then we have no cause for conflict.

### Amassari_Evil:Amassari_Evil - speaker name not found
**Raid005_Base_4**
Their fate is already sealed. We will not warn you again!

## RAID005_BASE1_DIALOG

Vessel, this is the Hiigaran fleet. Standby for assistance.

### amassari_01:Amassari
**Raid005_WreckShip_2**
The creed delivers! We had given up all hope. We stand ready to receive you, Hiigarans.

### Joanna:Joanna
**Raid005_WreckShip_3**
Their hyperdrives will be repaired momentarily but they need to make it out of the asteroid field to activate them, lets stick around until then.

## RAID005_LASTBATTLE_DIALOG

### Joanna:Joanna

We have information the Palantine Light was often traveling with an Iyatequa ship, the Checkered Mule. We’re still gathering information.

## QE_IYAFAL_2023_DAY02_T1_END

Some of these containers match the Palantine Light manifest, but they were likely sold. We’re trying to back-track sales history with the Iyatequa now.

Commander, we found a log buoy from the Palatine Light. Only one message was found, I’ve sent it to your inbox so you can look at it privately.

### Joanna:Joanna

### Joanna:Joanna

Commander, reading the list Gideon left us, I do not recognize any of these items. Maybe Ekekko, our liaison with the Iyatequa, can help us find them.

Splendid, my friend. Splendid! These resources should be sufficient to make the right inquiries about ancient objects. I'll put out feelers, as they say.

### Joanna:Joanna

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_B_end_1**
You're in luck, friend! I managed to find a seller for some of the parts you are seeking. With a little luck and a hefty amount of credits, I can arrange to acquire them for you.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_B_end_2**

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_C_end_2**
I was able to haggle additional information. One of the parts you're seeking has cultural significance to the Yaot. A fleet under the command of Zaque Guahai is looking for it now. Good luck!

### Guahai:Guahai

...and continue scouring the region! Finding the Stambha has utmost priority. You will locate that reconnaissance disk, or there will be...

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_A_end_3**
Interesting. Reconnaissance disks are usually part of a ship's integral data box. If we collect salvage from hostiles in the area, we might be able to find this item first.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_B_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_B_end_1**

**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_C_end_2**
Your blaspheme against the Makers will not be forgotten, Hiigarans! The Stambha is not supposed to be in your hands! Your transgression will be remembered.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_C_end_3**
It seems odd that the Yaot attach so much significance to a deep-space antenna. But then, our own people believed Sajuuk was a deity before finding the ship bearing the name.

We have scanned the sector successfully, but discovered nothing of significance. Gideon, what are we looking for?

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day04_A_end_2**
Commander, in order to use the antenna we must find a specific piece of Progenitor equipment to match it as a receiver. An adapter also must be build to connect them.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_B_T1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day04_B_end_1**
Resources received and processed. We should focus our efforts on finding the receiver component, but I have come up with no leads yet.

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day04_B_end_2**
Well and met, friend. I have heard vague rumors that an object of the given description is in possession of a powerful outlaw. I suggest stirring up the local underworld.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_C_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day04_C_end_1**
Commander, many criminals have heard stories about the object in question. It is rumored to be stolen in a legendary heist from a Tanoch temple.

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day04_C_end_2**
The Tanoch? I'm afraid I don't have many contacts with the Empire. But didn't you make friends with one of their commanders?

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_A_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_A_end_1**
Commander, we have succeeded in opening a communication channel to Tepin Papan. Sending a request for assistance now.

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_A_end_2**
Greeting, Commander. It has been too long. The information you seek is rather difficult to obtain, but for a few favors, I might be able to take the risk on your behalf.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_B_T1_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_B_end_1**
Thank you for your help. We call the artifact you seek the Chintamani. It was indeed stolen recently. If you're willing to provide some more assistance, I can send you the report.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_B_end_2**
We appreciate the help, Commander. We stand ready to assist you.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_C_T1_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_C_end_1**
The Empire is most satisfied with your work. I am sending you the report now. We suspect a Cangacian pirate was responsible for the theft. Good luck tracking him down.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_C_end_2**
Thank you, Commander. We will pass on the reports to Lazarus Base to be processed.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_A_T1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day06_A_end_1**
Commander, I formulated a new training program for the crew that will man the device once it's constructed. We should begin practice immediately.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_B_T1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day06_B_end_1**
Your officer’s flexibility and adaptability is to be commended. What remains to be seen is combined integration between officers, crew, and ship.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day06_B_end_2**
Commander, the training program teaches the crew to operate a hyperspace gate. Are we... trying to go home?

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_C_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day06_C_end_1**
Commander, we're receiving a coded transmission from a Yaot source. It's Guahai.

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day06_C_end_2**
Your theft of the Stambha remains inexcusable, Hiigarans. However, I am willing to pardon this offense if you follow my orders

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_A_T1_END

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_A_end_1**
You are wise to follow my command, outsider. We will transmit specific alloy recipes for your refinery. Make sure your foundry masters adhere to them precisely!

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_A_end_2**
Commander, Guahai plays all tough, but he seems worried. He must need us to reinforce his fleet out here.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_B_T1_END

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_B_end_1**
The alloys you provided were crude, but acceptable. I am instructing my fleet’s engineers to send you specifications for parts we require. If you do this, I might consider your slight expunged.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_B_end_2**
Guahai's fleet must be in dire need of repairs, Commander. We might get off the hook easily this time.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_C_T1_END

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_C_end_1**
Hiigarans, our business has concluded, your sin is hereby absolved. Be wary of crossing our paths in the future. Repeated offenses will not be forgiven.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_C_end_2**
Our altercation with the Yaot is resolved for now. We should resume our quest to locate the last component for Gideon's device.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_A_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_A_end_1**
Commander, we found the intel we need. The Fleet of Rams indeed have the artifact we seek. It is in the possession of Catequil, one of their Lieutenants.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_A_end_2**
Outstanding. Commander, please retrieve the component as soon as possible. I can't wait to finalize the construction of the Progenitor Negotiator.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_B_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_B_end_1**
Commander, we have an incoming transmission. It's a Cangacian frequency.

### Catequil:Catequil
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_B_end_2**
I know what you are trying to do, Hiigarans. Obtaining this treasure has gained me great fame among my people. I will not hand it over to you willingly!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_C_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_C_end_1**
Commander, we retrieved the stolen Progenitor artifact from Catequil and transferred it to the laboratory.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_C_end_2**
Finally! This receiver perfectly matches the antenna. I will see to the completion of the Progenitor Negotiator at once. This device will shake the history of Nimbus.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_A_T1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_A_end_1**
Your officer has been trained to use the new device I have engineered. For security reasons, I cannot specify what it does until we reach the special operation area.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_A_end_2**
Commander, chatter among the crew indicates Gideon's device will communicate to a hyperspace gate. I just hope we won't have another gate disaster like when we entered Nimbus.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_B_T1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_B_end_1**
Excellent, the freighter now has the parts needed for the special operation. Next, we must perform one final systems check so all can be ready.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_B_end_2**
If this special operation is what I think it is, I can't help but think of how we got into all of this in the first place. Admiral Enoch's final command of returning home always felt impossible to complete.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_C_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_C_end_1**
Commander, all forces are ready for the special operation.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_C_end_2**
Excellent. You have done well, Commander. Very soon we will embark on the most important operation of our careers. All our efforts will pay off, I promise!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY10_A_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day10_A_end_1**
Commander… we came across this at the gate. It’s a log transmission from Admiral Enoch. I’ve sent it to your private mail to review on your own.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_A_T2_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_A_end_1**
Commander, the transmission from Lazarus contains secret information on Progenitor technology. Details are classified, but I'll need you to investigate a list of certain items.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_A_end_2**
The transmission has a priority directive attached to it, making these our official new orders. Let us begin immediately.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_B_T2_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_B_end_1**
Excellent. We have harvested many required items from destroyed wreckages. Now I need you to find an intact Progenitor Cognition Node.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_B_end_2**
Commander, Gideon's secrecy can only mean he's working on something important. I wonder where his research will lead us.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_C_T2_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_C_end_1**
Thank you, Commander. I will start my research on the Progenitor Cognition Node. I need you to acquire more components in the meantime. I left a list with your adjutant.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_C_end_2**
Commander, reading the list Gideon left us, I do not recognize any of these items. Maybe Ekekko, our liaison with the Iyatequa, can help us find them.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_A_T2_END

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_A_end_1**
Splendid, my friend. Splendid! These resources should be sufficient to make the right inquiries about ancient objects. I'll put out feelers, as they say.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_A_end_2**
I have an uneasy feeling about Ekekko's contacts. I hope we can make the right impression.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_B_T2_END

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_B_end_1**
You're in luck, friend! I managed to find a seller for some of the parts you are seeking. With a little luck and a hefty amount of credits, I can arrange to acquire them for you.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_B_end_2**
Thank you Ekekko. I'm sure we can find something in our cargo hold to exchange for credits.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_C_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_C_end_1**
Excellent news, Commander! We managed to acquire much of Gideon's list in the transaction. Only a few parts remain.

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_C_end_2**
I was able to haggle additional information. One of the parts you're seeking has cultural significance to the Yaot. A fleet under the command of Zaque Guahai is looking for it now. Good luck!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_A_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_A_end_1**
Commander! We recovered Yaot communication from the transmission logs of one of the downed ships.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_A_end_3**
Interesting. Reconnaissance disks are usually part of a ship's integral data box. If we collect salvage from hostiles in the area, we might be able to find this item first.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_B_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_B_end_1**

We have found the artifact and transferred it to the laboratory. Commander, the Yaot must know we have it, incoming transmission from Guahai.

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_C_end_2**
Your blaspheme against the Makers will not be forgotten, Hiigarans! The Stambha is not supposed to be in your hands! Your transgression will be remembered.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_C_end_3**
It seems odd that the Yaot attach so much significance to a deep-space antenna. But then, our own people believed Sajuuk was a deity before finding the ship bearing the name.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_A_T3_END

### Joanna:Joanna

We have scanned the sector successfully, but discovered nothing of significance. Gideon, what are we looking for?

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day04_A_end_2**
Commander, in order to use the antenna we must find a specific piece of Progenitor equipment to match it as a receiver. An adapter also must be build to connect them.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_B_T3_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day04_B_end_2**
Well and met, friend. I have heard vague rumors that an object of the given description is in possession of a powerful outlaw. I suggest stirring up the local underworld.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY04_C_T3_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day04_C_end_1**
Commander, many criminals have heard stories about the object in question. It is rumored to be stolen in a legendary heist from a Tanoch temple.

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day04_C_end_2**
The Tanoch? I'm afraid I don't have many contacts with the Empire. But didn't you make friends with one of their commanders?

Commander, we have succeeded in opening a communication channel to Tepin Papan. Sending a request for assistance now.

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_A_end_2**
Greeting, Commander. It has been too long. The information you seek is rather difficult to obtain, but for a few favors, I might be able to take the risk on your behalf.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_B_T3_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_B_end_1**
Thank you for your help. We call the artifact you seek the Chintamani. It was indeed stolen recently. If you're willing to provide some more assistance, I can send you the report.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_B_end_2**
We appreciate the help, Commander. We stand ready to assist you.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY05_C_T3_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_C_end_1**
The Empire is most satisfied with your work. I am sending you the report now. We suspect a Cangacian pirate was responsible for the theft. Good luck tracking him down.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day05_C_end_2**
Thank you, Commander. We will pass on the reports to Lazarus Base to be processed.

Commander, I formulated a new training program for the crew that will man the device once it's constructed. We should begin practice immediately.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day06_B_end_1**
Your officer’s flexibility and adaptability is to be commended. What remains to be seen is combined integration between officers, crew, and ship.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day06_B_end_2**
Commander, the training program teaches the crew to operate a hyperspace gate. Are we... trying to go home?

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY06_C_T3_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day06_C_end_1**
Commander, we're receiving a coded transmission from a Yaot source. It's Guahai.

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day06_C_end_2**
Your theft of the Stambha remains inexcusable, Hiigarans. However, I am willing to pardon this offense if you follow my orders

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_A_T3_END

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_A_end_1**
You are wise to follow my command, outsider. We will transmit specific alloy recipes for your refinery. Make sure your foundry masters adhere to them precisely!

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_A_end_2**
Commander, Guahai plays all tough, but he seems worried. He must need us to reinforce his fleet out here.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_B_T3_END

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_B_end_1**
The alloys you provided were crude, but acceptable. I am instructing my fleet’s engineers to send you specifications for parts we require. If you do this, I might consider your slight expunged.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_B_end_2**
Guahai's fleet must be in dire need of repairs, Commander. We might get off the hook easily this time.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY07_C_T3_END

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_C_end_1**
Hiigarans, our business has concluded, your sin is hereby absolved. Be wary of crossing our paths in the future. Repeated offenses will not be forgiven.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day07_C_end_2**
Our altercation with the Yaot is resolved for now. We should resume our quest to locate the last component for Gideon's device.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_A_T3_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_A_end_1**
Commander, we found the intel we need. The Fleet of Rams indeed have the artifact we seek. It is in the possession of Catequil, one of their Lieutenants.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_A_end_2**
Outstanding. Commander, please retrieve the component as soon as possible. I can't wait to finalize the construction of the Progenitor Negotiator.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_B_T3_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_B_end_1**
Commander, we have an incoming transmission. It's a Cangacian frequency.

### Catequil:Catequil
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_B_end_2**
I know what you are trying to do, Hiigarans. Obtaining this treasure has gained me great fame among my people. I will not hand it over to you willingly!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY08_C_T3_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_C_end_1**
Commander, we retrieved the stolen Progenitor artifact from Catequil and transferred it to the laboratory.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day08_C_end_2**
Finally! This receiver perfectly matches the antenna. I will see to the completion of the Progenitor Negotiator at once. This device will shake the history of Nimbus.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_A_end_1**
Your officer has been trained to use the new device I have engineered. For security reasons, I cannot specify what it does until we reach the special operation area.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_A_end_2**
Commander, chatter among the crew indicates Gideon's device will communicate to a hyperspace gate. I just hope we won't have another gate disaster like when we entered Nimbus.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_B_T3_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_B_end_1**
Excellent, the freighter now has the parts needed for the special operation. Next, we must perform one final systems check so all can be ready.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_B_end_2**
If this special operation is what I think it is, I can't help but think of how we got into all of this in the first place. Admiral Enoch's final command of returning home always felt impossible to complete.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY09_C_T3_END

**dia_anniversary_2023_day09_C_end_1**
Commander, all forces are ready for the special operation.

Excellent. You have done well, Commander. Very soon we will embark on the most important operation of our careers. All our efforts will pay off, I promise!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY10_A_T3_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day10_A_end_1**
Commander… we came across this at the gate. It’s a log transmission from Admiral Enoch. I’ve sent it to your private mail to review on your own.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_A_T4_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_A_end_1**
Commander, the transmission from Lazarus contains secret information on Progenitor technology. Details are classified, but I'll need you to investigate a list of certain items.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_A_end_2**
The transmission has a priority directive attached to it, making these our official new orders. Let us begin immediately.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_B_T4_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_B_end_1**
Excellent. We have harvested many required items from destroyed wreckages. Now I need you to find an intact Progenitor Cognition Node.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_B_end_2**
Commander, Gideon's secrecy can only mean he's working on something important. I wonder where his research will lead us.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY01_C_T4_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_C_end_1**
Thank you, Commander. I will start my research on the Progenitor Cognition Node. I need you to acquire more components in the meantime. I left a list with your adjutant.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day01_C_end_2**
Commander, reading the list Gideon left us, I do not recognize any of these items. Maybe Ekekko, our liaison with the Iyatequa, can help us find them.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_A_T4_END

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_A_end_1**
Splendid, my friend. Splendid! These resources should be sufficient to make the right inquiries about ancient objects. I'll put out feelers, as they say.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_A_end_2**
I have an uneasy feeling about Ekekko's contacts. I hope we can make the right impression.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_B_T4_END

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_B_end_1**
You're in luck, friend! I managed to find a seller for some of the parts you are seeking. With a little luck and a hefty amount of credits, I can arrange to acquire them for you.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_B_end_2**
Thank you Ekekko. I'm sure we can find something in our cargo hold to exchange for credits.

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY02_C_T4_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_C_end_1**
Excellent news, Commander! We managed to acquire much of Gideon's list in the transaction. Only a few parts remain.

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_anniversary_2023_day02_C_end_2**
I was able to haggle additional information. One of the parts you're seeking has cultural significance to the Yaot. A fleet under the command of Zaque Guahai is looking for it now. Good luck!

## QE_ANNIVERSARY_2023_DAY03_A_T4_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_A_end_1**
Commander! We recovered Yaot communication from the transmission logs of one of the downed ships.

### Guahai:Guahai
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_A_end_2**
...and continue scouring the region! Finding the Stambha has utmost priority. You will locate that reconnaissance disk, or there will be...

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_anniversary_2023_day03_A_end_3**
Interesting. Reconnaissance disks are usually part of a ship's integral data box. If we collect salvage from hostiles in the area, we might be able to find this item first.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY01_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day01_end_1**
This Progenitor behavior is unlike anything we’ve seen before. They’re actively attacking now, they’ve only been passive before.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day01_end_2**
Everything started with the corrupted Keeper at the gate. The last time Progenitor devices behaved like this was many thousands of years ago... at the close of the Progenitor Empire. History must not repeat!

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY02_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day02_end_1**
We have delivered the raw material to the refineries in need, Commander. The defenses are strong for now, but they won't hold off the Progenitor attacks forever.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day02_end_2**
We triggered this incursion... It is our responsibility to find a way to stop it. We should collect data and begin research immediately

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY03_T1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day03_end_1**
Commander, what we have gathered indicates the active Progenitors being controlled by a malignant frequency. It must come from the corrupted Keeper.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day03_end_2**
So we can put an end to the attacks by taking out the errant Keeper? But at the gate we couldn't even harm it...

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY04_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day04_end_1**
We delivered the rare material to support the defense forces. Most garrisons are still holding strong, but the continual assaults are starting to weaken many sectors.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day04_end_2**
We must hasten our search for the errant Keeper. I might be able to triangulate its location, but first I need to decrypt the malignant command frequency.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY05_T1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day05_end_1**
I analyzed the command frequency. I don't understand... It's absurdly powerful. I suspect another Progenitor technology must be channeling energy to the Keeper.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day05_end_2**
Something else is energizing the corrupted Keeper? Perhaps destroying this source will neutralize its strange regenerative powers.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY06_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day06_end_1**
We provided the parts to replenish the defense forces. Their resolve is still strong, but at this rate of attrition, many systems won't be able to hold out much longer.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day06_end_2**
Commander, I fully decrypt the malignant command frequency. If we collect components from receiving Progenitor vessels I can start to triangulate the errant Keeper's location.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY07_T1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day07_end_1**
Commander, I finally found the source of the errant Keeper's signal. It is coming from a system in Cangacian space.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day07_end_2**
Excellent. Knowing these pirates, we'll have to arrange safe travel. We can't have anybody messing up our operation again. The fate of the galaxy hinges on this mission.

Commander, as this mission is of the utmost importance, I advise you to perform one last fleet wide ready-check.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY09_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day09_end_1**
Commander, all systems are ready for our critical mission. Gideon has provided us with the exact location of the Keeper's signal. We are ready.

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_halloween_2023_day09_end_2**
Greetings, friend. It came to my attention that you need to negotiate a non-aggression agreement with the Cangacians. I'll see what my contacts can do.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY10_T1_END

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_halloween_2023_day10_end_1**
My contacts have reached an agreement with the Cangacian warlords. They'll stay out of your way. I trust in your abilities to end this scourge. It has been egregious for everybody's business.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day10_end_2**
I've loaded the coordinates into the navigation system, Commander. We're ready. Let's end this Progenitor incursion once and for all.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY01_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day01_end_1**
This Progenitor behavior is unlike anything we’ve seen before. They’re actively attacking now, they’ve only been passive before.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day01_end_2**
Everything started with the corrupted Keeper at the gate. The last time Progenitor devices behaved like this was many thousands of years ago... at the close of the Progenitor Empire. History must not repeat!

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY02_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day02_end_1**
We have delivered the raw material to the refineries in need, Commander. The defenses are strong for now, but they won't hold off the Progenitor attacks forever.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day02_end_2**
We triggered this incursion... It is our responsibility to find a way to stop it. We should collect data and begin research immediately

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY03_T2_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day03_end_1**
Commander, what we have gathered indicates the active Progenitors being controlled by a malignant frequency. It must come from the corrupted Keeper.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day03_end_2**
So we can put an end to the attacks by taking out the errant Keeper? But at the gate we couldn't even harm it...

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY04_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day04_end_1**
We delivered the rare material to support the defense forces. Most garrisons are still holding strong, but the continual assaults are starting to weaken many sectors.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day04_end_2**
We must hasten our search for the errant Keeper. I might be able to triangulate its location, but first I need to decrypt the malignant command frequency.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY05_T2_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day05_end_1**
I analyzed the command frequency. I don't understand... It's absurdly powerful. I suspect another Progenitor technology must be channeling energy to the Keeper.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day05_end_2**
Something else is energizing the corrupted Keeper? Perhaps destroying this source will neutralize its strange regenerative powers.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY06_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_halloween_2023_day06_end_1**
We provided the parts to replenish the defense forces. Their resolve is still strong, but at this rate of attrition, many systems won't be able to hold out much longer.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day06_end_2**
Commander, I fully decrypt the malignant command frequency. If we collect components from receiving Progenitor vessels I can start to triangulate the errant Keeper's location.

## QE_HALLOWEEN_2023_DAY07_T2_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_halloween_2023_day07_end_1**

### Joanna:Joanna

**dia_tanWin_2023_day01_end_1**
Greetings, Commander. I am Toci Citalicue, and I will act as liaison between you and my people, the Chicuat. I cannot thank you enough for your aid in this troubled time.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day01_end_2**
It is our pleasure to help wherever we can. Lazarus offers assistance to all friendly factions still recovering from the recent Progenitor assaults.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY02_T1_END

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day02_end_1**
We’ve been able to restore critical machinery which will help us stabilize our industry. Thank you, it wouldn’t be possible without your assistance.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day02_end_2**
Commander, I'm wondering why the Empire isn't helping the Chicuat. It seems the Tanoch have abandoned these people to their fate.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY03_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day03_end_1**
Commander, we found cargo belonging to the Chicuat. Foodstuffs, basic machinery, textiles… not the valuable loot you'd expect.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day03_end_2**
My people have suffered many raids on basic infrastructure lately. Whoever is behind these attacks is trying to destabilize us even further. This madness is inhumane!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY04_T1_END

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_tanWin_2023_day04_end_1**
We have a deal! My friends among the Iyatequa have agreed to open up new shipping lanes to the Chicuat and supply basic goods.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day04_end_2**
I'm deeply thankful for your support. This trade will surely allieviate some suffering among my people. I just hope we can put a stop to the raids soon.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY06_T1_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_tanWin_2023_day06_end_1**
Greetings Commander. I'm pleased to hear you've been assisting my kinsmen, the Chicuat. I'm surprised you suspect the Tecuban behind these attacks, but I'm sending what information I have.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day06_end_2**
I'm surprised you know Tepin Papan. Though many Tanoch hold my people with destain, every Chicuat is proud to serve in the Empire. I'm relieved to know we have his assistance.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day06_end_3**
We met Tepin Papan in the Empty Quarter shortly after we arrived in Nimbus. Lazarus Base will process his information on the Tecuban.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY07_T1_END

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day07_end_1**
Commander, we found communications data among the wreckages that contains Heyoka's name. He must be involved with the local criminal network.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day07_end_2**
I'm astounded the Tecuban would fall in with criminals. They may be destitute as we are, but even they would not normally raise a fist against other Tanoch.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY08_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day08_end_1**
Commander, we retrieved more communications data between the criminals and Heyoka. We were able to trace his last location to a system called Acatla.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day08_end_2**
Acatla? How can this be? That is well within Chicuat borders. Commander, I implore you, please investigate immediately!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY09_T1_END

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day09_end_1**
Hiigaran combat power is impressive, Commander. The Chicuat have always suffered persecution within the Empire. It feels very good to have a powerful ally for once.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day09_end_2**
We understand the desperation. Only a century ago, we were just six hundred thousand exiles fighting an interstellar empire to retake our lost homeworld. We stand by your side in this conflict.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY11_T1_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_tanWin_2023_day11_end_1**
It has been rumored the Vaygr are sheltering in Tecuban space. I will learn what I can, but these Vaygr have the patrongae of the Emperor. It will be difficult.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day11_end_2**
The Vaygr are friends of the Emperor? Perhaps this is why the Empire is turning a deaf ear to our current plight. We may be hated, but never has the Empire ignored us as they have in this time.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY12_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day12_end_1**
Commander, we are not finding any hard evidence of the Vaygr's activity around these systems. We're only picking up whispered rumors among the locals.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day12_end_2**
The people have been through a lot lately. They're scared and uncertain. We'll need to gain their trust if we want to get someone to talk.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY13_T1_END

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day13_end_1**
Commander, our plan to gain the trust of the local people has worked. Our best lead comes from a nearby outpost.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day13_end_2**
That is great news. They claim to have information that could match our description of the Vaygr. But they want us to help them with something before they hand it over.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY14_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day14_end_1**
Commander, we received the information from the locals. It seems someone overheard a frigate crew boasting about working for powerful outsiders. This could be the Vaygr!

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day14_end_2**
I'm glad we could do something for the local people. Let's hunt down the Vaygr now and find out what they are scheming with the Tecuban!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY15_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day15_end_1**
Commander, onboard one of these vessels we found communications data with a Vaygr frequency. This is the lead we've been waiting for.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day15_end_2**
It's disturbing how many here are drawn to Vaygr promises of power, though I am not surprised. The Tecuban have even less than we do, and have more to gain from such an alliance.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY17_T1_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_tanWin_2023_day17_end_1**
Commander, I've expended every avenue to gather more information. To probe further would risk my position, and I cannot help my people if I'm dismissed from my post. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day17_end_2**
Even our allies in the Empire can no longer help us. What does Jochik have to gain through brutalizing my people? What does he want?

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_tanWin_2023_day17_end_3**
My friends, if the answer can't be aquired through proper channels we should turn to the local markets. Let the power of coin open the door between you and the answer you seek.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY18_T1_END

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_tanWin_2023_day18_end_1**
It's a deal, friends! A reputable source claims to have spoken to Jochik himself. He's seeking a very specific relic from the Makers, though I did not catch it's specifics.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day18_end_2**
My people have hidden many objects of the Makers we retain for study and safekeeping. Jochik delivers pain, suffering, and ruin to my people all to attain an object of the Makers? Monster!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY19_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day19_end_1**
Commander, we found a lot of data logs concerning Progenitor objects on these ships. We'll need to process them quickly. I'm sending them to the lab now.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_tanWin_2023_day19_end_2**
At your service, Commander. What a fascinating quantity of data. I'll do my best to come up with answers as soon as possible.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY20_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day20_end_1**
Commander, the Tecuban raiders are well armed and confident. Heyoka and Jochik must be coordinating closely for this operation.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day20_end_2**
All of this carngae for the greed of one and the ambition of the other! We must stop them, my people cannot withstand their assault for much longer!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY21_T1_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_tanWin_2023_day21_end_1**
Thanks for your assistance, Commander. With the provided information, I was able to pinpoint the particular object in question. Jochik is seeking a very rare object the Tanoch call a Baetyl.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day21_end_2**
Curse the Vaygr! They're after the Baetyl? It's placed at the Tlapallan Academy. It's one of our most populated learning centers! We must inform the Elders immediately!

My people have suffered many raids on basic infrastructure lately. Whoever is behind these attacks is trying to destabilize us even further. This madness is inhumane!

We have a deal! My friends among the Iyatequa have agreed to open up new shipping lanes to the Chicuat and supply basic goods.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day04_end_2**
I'm deeply thankful for your support. This trade will surely allieviate some suffering among my people. I just hope we can put a stop to the raids soon.

**dia_tanWin_2023_day06_end_1**
Greetings Commander. I'm pleased to hear you've been assisting my kinsmen, the Chicuat. I'm surprised you suspect the Tecuban behind these attacks, but I'm sending what information I have.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day06_end_2**
I'm surprised you know Tepin Papan. Though many Tanoch hold my people with destain, every Chicuat is proud to serve in the Empire. I'm relieved to know we have his assistance.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day06_end_3**
We met Tepin Papan in the Empty Quarter shortly after we arrived in Nimbus. Lazarus Base will process his information on the Tecuban.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY07_T2_END

Commander, we found communications data among the wreckages that contains Heyoka's name. He must be involved with the local criminal network.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day07_end_2**
I'm astounded the Tecuban would fall in with criminals. They may be destitute as we are, but even they would not normally raise a fist against other Tanoch.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY08_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day08_end_1**
Commander, we retrieved more communications data between the criminals and Heyoka. We were able to trace his last location to a system called Acatla.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day08_end_2**
Acatla? How can this be? That is well within Chicuat borders. Commander, I implore you, please investigate immediately!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY09_T2_END

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day09_end_1**
Hiigaran combat power is impressive, Commander. The Chicuat have always suffered persecution within the Empire. It feels very good to have a powerful ally for once.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day09_end_2**
We understand the desperation. Only a century ago, we were just six hundred thousand exiles fighting an interstellar empire to retake our lost homeworld. We stand by your side in this conflict.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY11_T2_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_tanWin_2023_day11_end_1**
It has been rumored the Vaygr are sheltering in Tecuban space. I will learn what I can, but these Vaygr have the patrongae of the Emperor. It will be difficult.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day11_end_2**
The Vaygr are friends of the Emperor? Perhaps this is why the Empire is turning a deaf ear to our current plight. We may be hated, but never has the Empire ignored us as they have in this time.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY12_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day12_end_1**
Commander, we are not finding any hard evidence of the Vaygr's activity around these systems. We're only picking up whispered rumors among the locals.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day12_end_2**
The people have been through a lot lately. They're scared and uncertain. We'll need to gain their trust if we want to get someone to talk.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY13_T2_END

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day13_end_1**
Commander, our plan to gain the trust of the local people has worked. Our best lead comes from a nearby outpost.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day13_end_2**
That is great news. They claim to have information that could match our description of the Vaygr. But they want us to help them with something before they hand it over.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY14_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day14_end_1**
Commander, we received the information from the locals. It seems someone overheard a frigate crew boasting about working for powerful outsiders. This could be the Vaygr!

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day14_end_2**
I'm glad we could do something for the local people. Let's hunt down the Vaygr now and find out what they are scheming with the Tecuban!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY15_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day15_end_1**
Commander, onboard one of these vessels we found communications data with a Vaygr frequency. This is the lead we've been waiting for.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day15_end_2**
It's disturbing how many here are drawn to Vaygr promises of power, though I am not surprised. The Tecuban have even less than we do, and have more to gain from such an alliance.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY17_T2_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_tanWin_2023_day17_end_1**
Commander, I've expended every avenue to gather more information. To probe further would risk my position, and I cannot help my people if I'm dismissed from my post. I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day17_end_2**
Even our allies in the Empire can no longer help us. What does Jochik have to gain through brutalizing my people? What does he want?

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_tanWin_2023_day17_end_3**
My friends, if the answer can't be aquired through proper channels we should turn to the local markets. Let the power of coin open the door between you and the answer you seek.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY18_T2_END

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_tanWin_2023_day18_end_1**
It's a deal, friends! A reputable source claims to have spoken to Jochik himself. He's seeking a very specific relic from the Makers, though I did not catch it's specifics.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day18_end_2**
My people have hidden many objects of the Makers we retain for study and safekeeping. Jochik delivers pain, suffering, and ruin to my people all to attain an object of the Makers? Monster!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY19_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day19_end_1**
Commander, we found a lot of data logs concerning Progenitor objects on these ships. We'll need to process them quickly. I'm sending them to the lab now.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_tanWin_2023_day19_end_2**
At your service, Commander. What a fascinating quantity of data. I'll do my best to come up with answers as soon as possible.

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY20_T2_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_tanWin_2023_day20_end_1**
Commander, the Tecuban raiders are well armed and confident. Heyoka and Jochik must be coordinating closely for this operation.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day20_end_2**
All of this carngae for the greed of one and the ambition of the other! We must stop them, my people cannot withstand their assault for much longer!

## QE_TANWIN_2023_DAY21_T2_END

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_tanWin_2023_day21_end_1**
Thanks for your assistance, Commander. With the provided information, I was able to pinpoint the particular object in question. Jochik is seeking a very rare object the Tanoch call a Baetyl.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day21_end_2**
Curse the Vaygr! They're after the Baetyl? It's placed at the Tlapallan Academy. It's one of our most populated learning centers! We must inform the Elders immediately!

### Joanna:Joanna

All of this carngae for the greed of one and the ambition of the other! We must stop them, my people cannot withstand their assault for much longer!

Thanks for your assistance, Commander. With the provided information, I was able to pinpoint the particular object in question. Jochik is seeking a very rare object the Tanoch call a Baetyl.

### Toci:Toci Citalicue
**dia_tanWin_2023_day21_end_2**
Curse the Vaygr! They're after the Baetyl? It's placed at the Tlapallan Academy. It's one of our most populated learning centers! We must inform the Elders immediately!

Hello, good friend! After some prying, I've learned Cangacian pirates have been hired by my fellows to raid some Yaot Pilgrims entering the area. What more, I cannot say.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day01_end_2**
Yaot pilgrims in the Empty Quarter? Commander, this might be of interest to Hiigaran security. We should find out more about what's going on.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY02_T1_END

### Ekekko:Ekekko
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day02_end_1**
Greetings, friend! My fellow tradesmen, of course, say nothing to me about their plans. But plenty of Cangacian marauders were eager to boast of their exploits.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day02_end_2**
Commander, the pirates believe there is valuable treasure on the Yaot pilgrim ships. But for now they were only able to capture basic civilian goods.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY03_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day03_end_1**
Commander, we can't find any traces of the Yaot pilgrimage. The area is swarming with pirates. They must know something we don't.

Commander, some of the containers we've recovered have casualties. Many were deceased, but we also recovered survivors in critical condition.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day04_end_2**
This is abhorrent... these can only be Yaot civilians! I am ordering them taken to medical away.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY05_T1_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_1**
Commander, we talked to the Yaot survivors. They were indeed part of the pilgrimage. They gave us their normal comm frequency, so we can contact the formation leader directly.

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_2**
A warm blessing to you, Hiigarans. I am Chocoan Coatl, Envoy of the Yaot Federation and Shepard of this Conjunction. I thank you for saving the lives of my fellow pilgrims.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_3**
Greetings Envoy Coatl. We greet you on behalf of the Hiigaran colonies in this area. Your pilgrimage has caused an uprising of pirate activity here. Our authorities are worried about the security situation.

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_4**
We are but simple Pilgrims Commander, bound by our faith to visit conjunctions seen in our sky. Until now we had no need for escort, for none took an interest in our mission. This seems to have changed without reason.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_5**
Commander, we can't leave these civilians defenseless against the pirates. It's unethical to stand by and allow it, we must help them.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY06_T1_END

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl

Commander, as requested we have tracked the delivery of the provided parts. It seems like some ships are clearly being prioritized over others.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day06_end_3**

You continue to meddle in affairs that are none of your business! I will have my treasure, and you will stop foiling my plans!

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day07_end_3**
Treasure? What treasure could be aboard these civilian ships? Have you no conscience terrorizing the innocent?

### Catequil:Catequil
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day07_end_4**
Innocent? You Hiigarans are so naive with your trust it's offensive. If you stand in my way again, I will crush you along with these charlatans you defend!

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY08_T1_END

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_1**
You gift us with your compassion, commander. Most would not go out of their way to defend a stranger.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_2**
We Hiigarans were once nearly defenseless refugees ourselves. But what is this pilgrimage, what drives you?

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_3**
Our people have made these voyages for centuries. Our history tells us great events coincide with the conjunctions, which must be witnessed. Some of them tell us of the presence of the Makers among us still.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_4**
This is fascinating... but I don't understand why your group would be targeted. Do you carry something special when observing the conjunction? An artifact of some kind?

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_5**
I'm afraid details such as these... must remain unspoken for now. I have much work to do, coordinating with the Elders. We will speak again.

### YaoGeneric:Yaot Commander
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day09_end_1**
Hiigaran commander, we have received your request for further information. The Yaot Federation cannot comment on the pilgrimages of the conjunctions. This is strictly a civilian affair, and outside the official business of the Federation. Good day.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day09_end_2**

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day10_end_2**
Yes. We're protecting the civilian pilgrims on their travels. Many believe some sort of treasure among their ships. We suspect some kind of involvement from the Yaot Elders.

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day10_end_3**
Interesting. Our intelligence concurs with your assessment. We have also suspected the Yaot have some other purpose behind these pilgrimages, something that has direct oversight from their council of Elders.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day10_end_4**
Could this be some secret agenda by their leadership? Are they searching for something? Searching for treasures?

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day10_end_5**
The only other thing I can tell you is that our scouts detected ruins of the Makers there previously. What they do with them, we don't know. Good hunting!

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day11_end_2**
Most interesting. This is a detailed report on the procedure of the pilgrim's convoy at astral conjunction events. I want this evaluated as quickly as possible!

Commander, I have been monitoring the situation and I will assist in the examination. If there is anything here involving the Progenitors, I will find it.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day13_end_2**
Envoy Coatl, this is Cangacian territory. It is almost certain the Cancagians will be waiting there in ambush. Is this event really so important to your people's faith that it's worth risking their lives?

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day13_end_3**
The decision... is not mine to make. We are guided by the wisdom of the Elders. But should you wish to provide escort, the people would be relieved to know we are under your protection.

Envoy Coatl, this is Cangacian territory. It is almost certain the Cancagians will be waiting there in ambush. Is this event really so important to your people's faith that it's worth risking their lives?

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day13_end_3**
The decision... is not mine to make. We are guided by the wisdom of the Elders. But should you wish to provide escort, the people would be relieved to know we are under your protection.

Hello, good friend! After some prying, I've learned Cangacian pirates have been hired by my fellows to raid some Yaot Pilgrims entering the area. What more, I cannot say.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day01_end_2**
Yaot pilgrims in the Empty Quarter? Commander, this might be of interest to Hiigaran security. We should find out more about what's going on.

**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day02_end_1**
Greetings, friend! My fellow tradesmen, of course, say nothing to me about their plans. But plenty of Cangacian marauders were eager to boast of their exploits.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day02_end_2**
Commander, the pirates believe there is valuable treasure on the Yaot pilgrim ships. But for now they were only able to capture basic civilian goods.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY03_T4_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day03_end_1**
Commander, we can't find any traces of the Yaot pilgrimage. The area is swarming with pirates. They must know something we don't.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY04_T4_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day04_end_1**
Commander, some of the containers we've recovered have casualties. Many were deceased, but we also recovered survivors in critical condition.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day04_end_2**
This is abhorrent... these can only be Yaot civilians! I am ordering them taken to medical away.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY05_T4_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_1**
Commander, we talked to the Yaot survivors. They were indeed part of the pilgrimage. They gave us their normal comm frequency, so we can contact the formation leader directly.

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_2**
A warm blessing to you, Hiigarans. I am Chocoan Coatl, Envoy of the Yaot Federation and Shepard of this Conjunction. I thank you for saving the lives of my fellow pilgrims.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_3**
Greetings Envoy Coatl. We greet you on behalf of the Hiigaran colonies in this area. Your pilgrimage has caused an uprising of pirate activity here. Our authorities are worried about the security situation.

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_4**
We are but simple Pilgrims Commander, bound by our faith to visit conjunctions seen in our sky. Until now we had no need for escort, for none took an interest in our mission. This seems to have changed without reason.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day05_end_5**
Commander, we can't leave these civilians defenseless against the pirates. It's unethical to stand by and allow it, we must help them.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY06_T4_END

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day06_end_1**
Blessings, Hiigarans. You have my thanks for these parts for our vessels. I am seeing to their distribution now.

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day06_end_2**
Commander, as requested we have tracked the delivery of the provided parts. It seems like some ships are clearly being prioritized over others.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day06_end_3**
Interesting. Could these be the treasure ships the pirates were talking about? We need to find out more.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY07_T4_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day07_end_1**
Commander, we have a direct communication from the Cangacian pirates.

### Catequil:Catequil
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day07_end_2**
You continue to meddle in affairs that are none of your business! I will have my treasure, and you will stop foiling my plans!

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day07_end_3**
Treasure? What treasure could be aboard these civilian ships? Have you no conscience terrorizing the innocent?

### Catequil:Catequil
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day07_end_4**
Innocent? You Hiigarans are so naive with your trust it's offensive. If you stand in my way again, I will crush you along with these charlatans you defend!

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY08_T4_END

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_1**
You gift us with your compassion, commander. Most would not go out of their way to defend a stranger.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_2**
We Hiigarans were once nearly defenseless refugees ourselves. But what is this pilgrimage, what drives you?

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_3**
Our people have made these voyages for centuries. Our history tells us great events coincide with the conjunctions, which must be witnessed. Some of them tell us of the presence of the Makers among us still.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_4**
This is fascinating... but I don't understand why your group would be targeted. Do you carry something special when observing the conjunction? An artifact of some kind?

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day08_end_5**
I'm afraid details such as these... must remain unspoken for now. I have much work to do, coordinating with the Elders. We will speak again.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY09_T4_END

### YaoGeneric:Yaot Commander
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day09_end_1**
Hiigaran commander, we have received your request for further information. The Yaot Federation cannot comment on the pilgrimages of the conjunctions. This is strictly a civilian affair, and outside the official business of the Federation. Good day.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day09_end_2**
That seemed unusually terse. We might need to think outside the box and find our other contacts for further information.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY10_T4_END

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day10_end_1**
Hello Commander! Thank you for the artifact, this will buy the information you seek. You're looking for more information on these conjunction pilgrimages?

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day10_end_2**
Yes. We're protecting the civilian pilgrims on their travels. Many believe some sort of treasure among their ships. We suspect some kind of involvement from the Yaot Elders.

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day10_end_3**
Interesting. Our intelligence concurs with your assessment. We have also suspected the Yaot have some other purpose behind these pilgrimages, something that has direct oversight from their council of Elders.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day10_end_4**
Could this be some secret agenda by their leadership? Are they searching for something? Searching for treasures?

### TepinPapan:Tepin Papan
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day10_end_5**
The only other thing I can tell you is that our scouts detected ruins of the Makers there previously. What they do with them, we don't know. Good hunting!

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY11_T4_END

### HiigaranCrewMember:Crew Member
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day11_end_1**
Commander, we've picked up a classified investigation report on the Yaot pilgrimage from one of the hostile vessels. Decryption process initiated.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day11_end_2**
Most interesting. This is a detailed report on the procedure of the pilgrim's convoy at astral conjunction events. I want this evaluated as quickly as possible!

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY12_T4_END

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day12_end_1**
Commander, we've collected ore from the asteroids near the astral conjunction site. The material is transferred into the laboratory to be examined.

### RaabSjet:Gideon S'jet
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day12_end_2**
Commander, I have been monitoring the situation and I will assist in the examination. If there is anything here involving the Progenitors, I will find it.

## QE_YAOSPR_2024_DAY13_T4_END

### Chocoan:Chocoan Coatl
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day13_end_1**
Blessings upon you, Commander. My people wish to convey their deepest thanks for your assistance. We are ready to engage the conjunction event in Ze Tavaan. May the Makers be with us.

### Joanna:Joanna
**dia_yaoSpr_2024_day13_end_2**
Envoy Coatl, this is Cangacian territory. It is almost certain the Cancagians will be waiting there in ambush. Is this event really so important to your people's faith that it's worth risking their lives?
