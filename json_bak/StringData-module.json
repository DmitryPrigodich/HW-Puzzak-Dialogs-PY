No great discovery is made without plenty of failure, but those great words sound differently now, as an Admiral in command of thousands about to embark into the unknown.\n\nI look at this roster of vessels under my command and find myself thinking of the men and women I will now be responsible for, our mission, and the failure rate of these expeditions. Under the direction of the Daiamid and the vision from Karan S’jet herself, we press on to uncover more secrets of the Progenitors. But it’s hard to imagine how our expedition will truly succeed where so many others vanish without a trace, especially ones bound for this universe.\n\nBut go we must. There’s too much at stake riding on us not knowing what lay on the other side. We know Makaan sent vessels through this gate and we must learn what became of them. If there’s a threat to Hiigara looming out there, it must be stopped, or at least investigated. We’ve fought for so long and so hard to just ignore this. So, we go.\n\nThough if we fail... none will know of our fate. We’ll be another few thousand sacrificed to this endeavor. What memorial will be erected in our memory? How will be honored by the people who sent us? I already know this new Daiamid is only using us as fodder for their ambitions. There will be no ceremony for us on Hiigara.\n\nSo if we are to go, I pray we can survive whatever fate stopped so many and find a future for our people. We have been exiles before, if we must be so again, so be it.

The seeds of the conflict began when the Warlord Makaan located a Progenitor Far-Jump Hyperspace Core- the third one to be found. Knowing that one was in possession of the enigmatic Bentusi and the other were held by the Hiigarans, he embarked on a war to claim all three and declare himself heir to the Progenitor legacy.\n\nWith the power of a far-jump hyperspace core to fuel his conquest, Makaan smashed the Taiidan Republic and began an overwhelming assault on the rest of the galactic core. The force of his attack shattered the unity of the Galactic Council, and only the leadership and dedication of the Hiigarans managed to prevent the galaxy from being overrun. In order to stop Makaan, the legendary figure Karan S’jet emerged from seclusion to personally lead the force to defeat him.\n\nKaran embarked on a voyage to discover the whereabouts of Sajuuk, which according to prophecy was where the three Progenitor Cores must be united. Along the way she received the Bentusi’s final gift, the first core, and raced to the center of the galaxy. There she and Makaan engaged in one final duel to the death, with the winner claiming the legacy of the Progenitors.

Evidently Jochik managed to climb his way to leadership of the Crusade and hatch a long-term plan in Nimbus. His confidence and haughtiness when facing the Hiigarans can only suggest he has a plan and is confident about its execution.\n\nHiigaran Intelligence has been unable to discern the purpose of his plan, as not even his own lieutenants seem to know, but it appears Jochik has a keen interest in specific Progenitor components. He is observed seeking specific parts or components, possibly to restore a Progenitor ruin, but what that ruin is and to what end is unknown.

A Collective has their own celebrations and culture, but it is not strong enough to be distinct from the broader Tanoch society. A Collective is lead by an individual Calpolec, who is elected for life. As these structures predate the rise of the modern Tanoch Empire, many of them are traditionally headed by a female Calpolec.\n\nThe Zatozi Collective exists on the fringe of Tanoch Space within Centeotl, based on Teozacoz. Primarily consisting of ethnic Tanoch, they often suffer opposition from the Chiucat who outnumber them in the region. Nevertheless, they can count on state support for assistance, as the Empire is always quick to help those of Tanoch descent.\n\nThe Zatozi have recently appointed a new Calpolec, Cozcaua, who has made it his mission to mine the Sarassian Sea. The Collective lacks equipment of their own, so Cozcaua is subcontracting spacers and crews to mine on behalf of the Collective . These crews and spacers go and gather the resources, and in exchange the Zatozi Collective gives them some kind of legal protection and service in the eyes of the Tanoch Empire. Though crews employed by the Zatozi are not literally employed by the Tanoch Empire, it’s the closest one will have to official Tanoch service within the Sarassian."}, "glossary.factionWarFactions.title.enterprise": {"en:": "The Sogamoso Enterprise"}, "glossary.factionWarFactions.text.enterprise": {"en:": "Many of the old families in the Yaot Federation have various vices and ambitions; the wealthier and older the family the more esoteric the venture, usually.

The Sogamoso’s feats include locating three of the five Pillars, discovering the location of the Vendu, recovering a vessel of the First Fleet, and charting two thirds of the hyperspace gates located in Yaot territory.\n\nRecently the Sogamoso have turned their attention to the Sarassian sea. Elder Sagipa has long been fascinated with the region, and now has the political pull within the Federation council to sanction his interest in the region. To save costs and preserve his own military assets, he is offsetting the costs by extending a contract specifically to Hiigaran ship captains to explore and mine the area. Many believe it is to set up future expeditions with the hope of building Yaot-alligned way-stations in the region. Others believe he is acting in the interests of the Federation by establishing bases on the far side of Tanoch space for a strategic advantage.\n\nBecause of the reach and breadth of the Sogamoso, they have their own currency and officers. They are one of eight large families within the Yaot Federation, and one of three to issue their own currency. The power of their prestige is large enough that they can elevate themselves above Yaot society in this way, making them a kind of sub-class to the upper classes and elite."}, "glossary.factionWar.factionWarSeasons.title": {"en:": "Seasons & Cycles"}, "glossary.factionWarSeasons.title.season": {"en:": "Seasons"}, "glossary.factionWarSeasons.text.season": {"en:": "A season ends when the fourth cycle ends.
