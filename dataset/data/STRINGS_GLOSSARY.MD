Main HUD

### glossary.mainhud.text.intro
This is the main HUD in the so called Combat View. In this section of the glossary, we will go through every element and explaining every panel, every button and what their function is.

The main HUD is divided into several sections. On the left we have the skill bar, with the mission and assignment view above. In the very top-left you can find the player profile and internal view. At the top we have the controls for the auto-attack mode, the sensor manager and the auto-camera mode. In the top-right corner you can find the controls to switch between combat, system and galaxy views as well as opening the social tab. Below you have the control for unit groups and to the right of the screen you can find the station services and target lists. On the bottom of the screen you have the unit tray, which is essential for controling your fleet.

### glossary.mainhud.mainhudleft.title
Left Main HUD

Left Main HUD

### glossary.mainhudleft.text.intro
On the left you can find your skill bar. Skills are an integral part to the game, and this is the part of the main HUD where you can use them.

### glossary.mainhudleft.title.skillbar
Skill Bar

### glossary.mainhudleft.text.skillbar
This is your skill bar. It shows all the skills you can use with your current setup from the officer bridge. The large number on the top is your energy level, where the small number next to each skill is the energy that skill uses when activated.

If a skill is greyed out you cannot use it. This can be for several reasons: Some skills need you to have at least one turret of a specific type equipped. Missile Barrage for example requires at least one missile turret to be equipped on your flagship. Skills will also be greyed out if you don't have enough energy to use them, or if there are no enemies in range.

If you activate a skill, the skill needs to recharge, indicated by the skill icon filling up from the left to the right side.

To find systems in the galaxy or missions and belts in systems, you have to find and analyze them first.

### glossary.scanning.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title
Detecting & Analyzing

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.intro
Scanning is generally divided into detecting and analyzing. While detection reveals just the location and some basic information, analyzing will, once completed, reveal all information on the object to you.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.finding
Detection

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.finding
When you first enter a new system, you will not have any signals in the target list.

If you tap the scanning icon in the center of the main scanning UI you will send out a ping in the system, that will reveal the location of signals. Your first scanner will reveal three signals at a time, while a scanner of a higher tier will reveal more and more objects at once.

Detecting costs 5% of your scanner charge.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.analyzing
Analyzing

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.analyzing
Once you have found an object, you need to analyze it to show all the details in the target list. To analyze a signal, belt or any other object, you need tap it in the target list, and then tap on analyze.

Every time you tap analyze, it will cost 5% of your scanner charge. Then, the scanner will roll a number between your Scanning Reliability and your Scanner Strength which it will then add to your analysis progress.

Furthermore, there is a crit chance of 5% which will add double the current Analyzing Strength to your analyzing progress.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.header.stats
Scanning Stats

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.stats
This section will go over all the stats regarding your scanner.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.detection
Detection Power

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.detection
The detection power of your scanner is a threshold that determines if your scanner is powerful enough to find objects. If the detection power is larger than the signal needs, your scanner will detect and reveal it for you to analyze. Every time you scan to detect a signal, it will drain your detection power as it is linked to your scanner charge. Recharging your scanner will increase your detection power again.

The Detection Power ceiling can be increased by upgrading the scanner.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.count
Detection Count

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.count
The detection count is the number of signals your scanner can reveal. Higher tier scanners have a higher detection count natively.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.charge
Charge

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge1
The scanner charge determins how often you can scan for objects or analyze objects you have already found.

The overal charge can go from 0% to 150%, where everything above 100% is called overcharging.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge2
Overcharging can only be achieved when consuming a battery, while below 100% the scanner recharges itself with a rate of 3% per minute.

Depending on your current scanner charge, the UI bar will change the color to the object rarity your scanner can potentially find in the system.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge3
Above you can see the state of your scanner charge in several differently tiered system. The first image is in a T0 system. As T0 does not have any Rare or Epic objects, only the Common rarity is displayed. The second image shows a a T1 system. As only rare objects exists only rarities until Rare are displayed. Finally, in the third image, T2 systems and higher may inhabit epic objects, the scanner will now also display the epic charge.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge4
The detection power threshold for every rarity can be lowered by upgrading the scanner that is currently equipped on your flagship. In the two images above, the right image has a higher scanner level than the left. The thresholds for each rarity is thus much lower.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.charge5
If you visit a system that is below the tier of your scanner, the thresholds will be a lot lower. This means, that in most cases, your scanner is so powerful that it can detect most rarities with any charge.

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.title.reliabilitystrength
Analyzing Reliability & Strength

### glossary.scanningfindingandanalyzing.text.reliabilitystrength
Analyzing Reliability is the base of your scanning roll, whereas Strength is the ceiling. Once you analyze an object, the scanner will have a random roll between your scanners reliability and the strength and then add this to your analyzing progress.

Both stats can be increased by either upgrading your scanner, by adding officers with the correct stat to the bridge or the module slot, or mounting internal modules.

### glossary.exploration.text.intro
Exploration is a big part of Homeworld. There is something to discover in every system.

### glossary.systemview.text.intro
Scanning is an integral part of the game. As you enter an unknown galaxy, you need to discover most missions and objects in space.
Scanning can be divided into scanning the galaxy, and scanning of systems. Several systems first need to be discovered and then analyzed before you are able to enter them.

In order to find systems, you need to be close to them as well has have a high enough detection. You can see your current detection power on the main scanner UI on the bottom of the screen.

Tapping the scan button will scan for systems that are nearby, and when the scan was succesful it will show the system as an "Unknown System" in the galaxy view as well as in the target list.

### glossary.scanning.scanningscanables.title
Unknown Finds

### glossary.scanningscanables.text.intro
Unknown finds are floating objects in space, that you can detect and analyze as well. Their content can range from materials, insignias, fragments and many more.

For detecting and analyzing they follow the same rules as signals.

### glossary.scanning.scanningbatteries.title
Batteries

### glossary.scanningbatteries.text.intro
While the charge of your scanner rechargers over time, it will only ever charge back up to 100%.

To find higher rarity objects, you need to overcharge your scanner. The only way to do this is to use a battery. This will add extra charge to your scanner and allows it to detect rarer objects.

Currently, common batteries or blueprints for higher rarities can drop from signal missions.

### glossary.scanningbatteries.title.rarities
Battery Rarities

### glossary.scanningbatteries.text.rarities
Depending on the rarity of the battery, it recharges the scanner more, the higher the rarity. Currently, the recharge rate are:

- Common: +25%
- Uncommon: +50%
- Rare: +75%
- Epic: +100%

### glossary.scanningbatteries.title.fabricating

Internal Modules

### glossary.flagshipinternalmodules.text.intro
Internal modules are all modules that can be mounted in special compartments inside your flagship. These modules can either be economy modules, like fabricators, refineries or extra storage space, as well as combat boosters that can influence your turrets or ships in your fleet.

### glossary.flagshipinternalmodules.title.compartments
Compartments & Size

### glossary.flagshipinternalmodules.text.compartments
The internal space in your flagships is divided into three different compartments: Front, Mid and Rear.
Each type of compartment can only mount a specific set of modules. For example, modules that increase your flagships power are generally mounted in the rear compartment, while economy or fleet modules can be mounted in the mid compartment and miscellaneous modules that boost sensor power or research are in the front compartment.

The only two exceptions are storage modules and the Adamant Extractor. These can both be mounted in all three compartments.

### glossary.flagshipinternalmodules.text.size1
Furthermore, every compartment and module has its own size. To mount a module, you need sufficient space in the compartment. The size of modules decreases the higher the tier, while the power of the module only increases with rarity.

Different compartments can have different sizes, depending on what type and tier your flagship is.

### glossary.flagshipinternalmodules.text.size2
In the image above you can see a selection of the same internal module, but from different tiers and rarities. Note that the higher the tier, the smaller the module becomes - the little number to the top right of every item .

### glossary.flagshipinternalmodules.title.frontcompartment
Front Compartment

### glossary.flagshiprefining.title.rareearth
Rare Earth

### glossary.flagshiprefining.text.rareearth
Rare Earth are a byproduct of refining. For each tier of ore there are different more common and rarer rare earths. These can be used to upgrade your internal and external modules, making them more effective.

The base chance to receive rare earth after refining one batch (200 ore) is 20% with a payout of 15 RE. You can improve this chance with better refineries or specialized officers. It is better to start larger refining jobs as the chances to receive rare earth even out with a bigger amount of ore.

### glossary.flagshiprefining.title.refining
Refining Process

### glossary.flagshiprefining.text.refining1
To start the refining process, tap the big plus in the center of the screen. If you do not have sufficient raw resources in your storage or your stash, a warning will be shown.

### glossary.flagshiprefining.text.refining2
After you selected the raw resources you want to refine, a slider to select the amount is displayed in the center of the screen as well as a detailed breakdown of the refinery process on the right.

### glossary.flagshiprefining.text.refining3
The basic ratio for ore to refined metal is 2 to 1 - meaing that 200 ore will always make 100 refined materials.

This ratio can be improved either with better refineries or with officers that have specialized passive skills.

### glossary.flagshiprefining.text.refining4
Depending on the tier of the ore and the tier of the refinery, an additional time cost penalty will be applied. This means that once you have the chance of fabricating a better refinery, it will save you a lot of process time in future.

### glossary.flagshiprefining.title.refinefromstash
Refining From Stash

### glossary.flagshiprefining.text.refinefromstash1
If you do not have all required materials to start a refining process in your storage, but have them in your stash, you can command a so called Refine From Stash.

Your on-ship fabricators are not able to build ships larger than strike craft. This is why you have access to shipyards at stations. This is always the last tab on the very left called SY.

Here you can mandate the construction of large escort ships and flagships. Once they are finished, you again need to visit a station to collect these ships.

You do not have access to a shipyard if you are not at a station.

The shipyard also does not have an officer slot. It will however be improved by officers you put on your bridge.

### glossary.flagshipfabrication.title.blueprints
Blueprints

### glossary.flagshipfabrication.text.blueprints
To fabricate an item, you first need to find a blueprint.

Blueprints are the instructions your engineers need to fabricate an item. You can find blueprints nearly everywhere: As an assignment reward, in one of the many markets or even as a reward for completing missions.

Blueprints can be limited or unlimited. Common blueprints are always unlimited, while uncommon, rare and epic blueprints are limited.
Limited blueprints can only be built once as they are consumed.

If a fabrication process is running, you currently cannot view all other blueprints you own.

Capacity

### glossary.flagshipstoragestash.text.capacity
Your flagship storage can only hold a certain amount of item stacks.

If your storage is full, you will no longer be able to jump to missions or strikes. However, you can still jump to outposts and stations so that you can empty your storage.

To increase the storage space, you can mount storage modules in your internal module space.

Keep in mind that your storage is universal across flagships. This means, that items will transfer from one to another flagship if you change loadouts. However, you might end up overburdened if the storage space of the flagship you switched to is smaller than the one before.

### glossary.flagshipstoragestash.header.stash
Stash

### glossary.flagshipstoragestash.text.stash
Whereas the storage is limited, the stash is not. This means that in your stash you can have an unlimited amount of items.

You can either access the stash directly via the station menu, or when you are in the storage menu on the left side.

Different to the storage, resources like ore and refined materials will be moved into one large stack that is unlimited in size. So, instead of three stacks of 10.000 refined material you will have one stack with 30.000 refined materials.

### glossary.flagshipstoragestash.text.itemstacks
On the left you have 9000 ore in the storage, divided into nine stacks, and on the right the same amount as one stack in the stash.

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.text.parts
To construct the starbase, you first need to aquire three parts that make up the starbase: The Orbital Stabilizer, the Space Frame as well as the Life Support Systems. Combining all three will give you your starbase.

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.title.blueprints
Starbase Blueprints

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.text.blueprints
You can buy the blueprints for the three parts in the three main faction liaison requisition shops. To unlock the right to buy them, you need to first completed the Questline "Uneasy Allies".

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.title.stabilizer
Orbital Stabilizer

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.text.stabilizer
The Orbital Stabilizer is the first part needed for constructing the starbase. The blueprint can be found in the Yaot Liaison Requisitions and requires reputation level 5. Furthermore it costs 149,000 credits.

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.title.frame
Space Frame

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.text.frame
The Space Frame is the second part needed for the starbase. The blueprint can be found in the Iyatequa liaison requsition and requires reputation level 5 and costs 149,000 credits.

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.title.lifesupport
Life Support Systems

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.text.lifesupport
The Space Frame is the last part needed for the starbase. The blueprint can be found in the Tanoch liaison requsition and requires reputation level 5 and costs 149,000 credits.

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.title.starbase
Fabricating the Starbase

### glossary.starbaseconstruction.text.starbase
After you built all three parts of the starbase, you now can buy the final blueprint in the market. This allows you to combine the parts in a shipyard to manufacture the Starbase.

The blueprint will be available in the market for purchase after your fabricated all three components.

### glossary.starbase.starbaseplacing.title
Starbase Placement

### glossary.starbaseplacing.text.intro
After you fabricated the starbase, you can now place it. The system you choose the place your orbital has great effect on the overall yield of your starbase modules. If you place your starbase into a system with a lot of jovians, the yield of your gas yield will be higher than if the system has a lot of moons or belts.

A starbase has to be in the orbit of a celestial object. You can choose an orbit of a jovian, terrestrial planet or a moon.

### glossary.starbaseplacing.title.placing
Placing the Starbase

### glossary.starbaseplacing.text.placing
To place the starbase, you need to be the System View. There, navigate to the target list and tap on the celestial objects tab. From there you can select at which celestial object you want to place your starbase at.

### glossary.starbaseplacing.title.moving
Moving the Starbase

### glossary.starbaseplacing.text.moving
If you are unhappy with your current placement of your starbase, you can always move it. First, you need a relocation ticket. Then, moving the starbase follows the same mechanics than placing it.
First, go into the system view of your desired target system, navigate to the celestial objects tab in the target list and then select your desired target location.

### glossary.starbaseplacing.text.relocationticket
To move a starbase, you need a Starbase Relocation Ticket. You can buy this in the market for 500 Adamant.

### glossary.factionwar.title
The Sarassian Wars

### glossary.factionwar.text.intro
The Sarassian Sea is home to many neutron stars, which make it dangerous for long term colonization as strong neutron storms wipe most of the region clean every four weeks.

Yet, despite the dangers, three different factions have decided to settle the Sarassian Sea in order to access the rare resources within.

Naturally, the Sarassian Sea attracts plenty of outlaws from all across the galaxy, using the neutron storms as a cover while they hunt after the resources and convoys for themselves. The three factions claiming this space offer handsome rewards to anyone who helps them secure their borders by expelling the outlaws.

Once a Sarassian War season ends, anyone pledged to the dominant faction is granted that season’s end reward, and the neutron storms reset the entire area, ready for the next season.

### glossary.factionwar.title.providers
The Guild of Providers

### glossary.factionwar.text.providers
The Guild is a self-professed subgroup of the Iyatequa Traders with a unique focus on exploration and daring adventures. Though the rest of the Iyatequa do not speak of them openly, the Guild is eager to recruit others into their extensive pursuits.

### glossary.factionwar.title.collective
The Zatozi Collective

### glossary.factionwar.text.collective
This small, family-owned venture comes from within the Tanoch Empire, operating out of Teozacoz. Recently they have dedicated their business to exploring and mining the Sarassian Sea. Modest in their outlook and honest in their aspirations, the Zatozi are driven by economic necessity as much as the desire for profit.

### glossary.factionwar.title.enterprise
The Sogamoso Enterprise

### glossary.factionwar.text.enterprise
A private corporation controlled by Elder Sagipa - one of the eight largest economic entities in the Yaot Federation. They are subcontracting Hiigaran captains to explore and secure the region, in part to trial working with the Hiigarans for future economic ventures.

### glossary.factionwarfactions.title.sarassiansea
The Sarrasian Sea

### glossary.factionwarfactions.text.sarassiansea
The Sarassian Sea is located some distance away, to the North-West, from the Tanoch Empire and beyond the Karagan Shoals. The region is a bit of a mystery to the known empires in the local region, known for a long time as a location in myth before Cangacian Scouts discovered safe hyperspace routes into the zone. The Sarassian Sea thus has not seen the millennia of conquest and colonization found in the local area.

For a long time the only settlers in the region are the furthest known Cangaican pirates fleeing the Tanoch Empire. They have had centuries to try navigating the Sarassian sea’s unusual properties, with many ships lost over time before the precise shielding methods could be devised. Even then, the constant polarity shifting from the nearby neutron stars makes computer technology unreliable. Most space settlements have had to fall back on more primitive means of maintaining their technology - computer use is reduced.

The Sarassian sea is characterized by very unusual Neutron stars located in the region. These emission stars broadcast on odd frequencies and as a result, frequently disrupt un-shielded computer systems and distort navigation data. That they are located in this region specifically is one of the many oddities about the Nimbus Galaxy itself. Due to the neutron stars, or in spite of them, the Sarassian sea is home to many rich and hard to find resources.

But where there are riches, there are dangers. The power of said neutrons sweeps through the region, cleansing it with extreme radiation bursts every four weeks precisely.

### glossary.factionwarfactions.title.providers
The Guild of Providers

### glossary.factionwarfactions.text.providers
Very little is known about the interior arrangement of the Iyatequa traders; how they are organized, factions within the larger organization, and personal allegiances. The Iyatequa are usually very tight-lipped about this. But one recent and very glaring exception is the Guild of Providers, which began soliciting aid for ventures to the Sarassian Sea. Their agents are easily spotted from among the Iyatequa traders by the bold teal sashes they wear marked with the logo of the Guild.

The relationship the guild holds with the rest of the Iyatequa is, putting it succinctly, remarkable. The traders never speak of the guild on their own, and is one of the only known lines of inquiry which would leave a tradesmen speechless. One is left with the sense that the Guild is controversial within the Iyatequa themselves- though not anything worthy of sanction or disapproval.

The Guild pays ship crews well for venturing into the Sarassian sea to retrieve objects for their behalf. Though they are only a recent Iyatequa phenomenon, they are becoming one of the more reputable areas of dealing with the tradesmen. Officers of the Guild rarely try to oversell or cajole services, they are among the most straightforward, professional negotiators of the Iyatequa.

### glossary.factionwarfactions.title.collective
The Zatozi Collective

### glossary.factionwarfactions.text.collective
Much of the Tanoch Empire’s resources and material needs are governed through a command economy, in which mines are commissioned and governed by state officials appointed by the Emperor’s bureau of economics. The Tanoch Empire overall directs and organizes regional labor towards goals of the Empire on a regional level. One exception to this is the Calpolli, or Collective.

A Tanoch collective is a collection of families connected either by blood or long association. These structures predate and persist in spite of the empire, serving more like social organizations and groupings for specific, stated purposes. A Collective could be organized for the construction of artisan spacecraft, or providing food and repairs across an entire quadrant. They are like a Kiith in that they are organized around a purpose, but unlike a Kiith they are not all bound by blood or consist of one family. A Collective has their own celebrations and culture, but it is not strong enough to be distinct from the broader Tanoch society. A Collective is lead by an individual Calpolec, who is elected for life. As these structures predate the rise of the modern Tanoch Empire, many of them are traditionally headed by a female Calpolec.

The Zatozi Collective exists on the fringe of Tanoch Space within Centeotl, based on Teozacoz. Primarily consisting of ethnic Tanoch, they often suffer opposition from the Chiucat who outnumber them in the region. Nevertheless, they can count on state support for assistance, as the Empire is always quick to help those of Tanoch descent.

The Zatozi have recently appointed a new Calpolec, Cozcaua, who has made it his mission to mine the Sarassian Sea. The Collective lacks equipment of their own, so Cozcaua is subcontracting spacers and crews to mine on behalf of the Collective . These crews and spacers go and gather the resources, and in exchange the Zatozi Collective gives them some kind of legal protection and service in the eyes of the Tanoch Empire. Though crews employed by the Zatozi are not literally employed by the Tanoch Empire, it’s the closest one will have to official Tanoch service within the Sarassian.

### glossary.factionwarfactions.title.enterprise
The Sogamoso Enterprise

### glossary.factionwarfactions.text.enterprise
Many of the old families in the Yaot Federation have various vices and ambitions; the wealthier and older the family the more esoteric the venture, usually. The Sogamoso family is no different, having a tendency to pursue great mysteries of Yaot mythology and history. The Sogamoso’s feats include locating three of the five Pillars, discovering the location of the Vendu, recovering a vessel of the First Fleet, and charting two thirds of the hyperspace gates located in Yaot territory.

Recently the Sogamoso have turned their attention to the Sarassian sea. Elder Sagipa has long been fascinated with the region, and now has the political pull within the Federation council to sanction his interest in the region. To save costs and preserve his own military assets, he is offsetting the costs by extending a contract specifically to Hiigaran ship captains to explore and mine the area. Many believe it is to set up future expeditions with the hope of building Yaot-alligned way-stations in the region. Others believe he is acting in the interests of the Federation by establishing bases on the far side of Tanoch space for a strategic advantage.

Because of the reach and breadth of the Sogamoso, they have their own currency and officers. They are one of eight large families within the Yaot Federation, and one of three to issue their own currency. The power of their prestige is large enough that they can elevate themselves above Yaot society in this way, making them a kind of sub-class to the upper classes and elite.

### glossary.factionwar.factionwarseasons.title
Seasons & Cycles

### glossary.factionwarseasons.title.season
Seasons

### glossary.factionwarseasons.text.season
A season ends when the fourth cycle ends. At this point all players who are pledged to the dominant faction receive the season’s end reward, in addition to all the regular rewards given to players at the end of a cycle.

Afterwards, the Sarassian Sea is reset back to its starting state and all emitters are removed from players' inventories. Use them or lose them!

Between seasons there is a short off-season time, lasting for only one to three days, depending on the month. You may still access the Sarassian market during that time and visit the Sarassian market, but the other systems are off-limits due to the neutron storms.

### glossary.factionwarseasons.title.cycles
Cycles

### glossary.factionwarseasons.text.cycles
Each season runs for four cycles, with each cycle being seven days in length.

At the end of a cycle, members of the dominant faction receive their cycle rewards and each player receives their Sarassian Credits, determined by the influence they gained by completing missions and their pledge strength.

Sarassian Credits can be turned in for items and resources in the Sarassian market.

### glossary.factionwar.factionwarpledging.title
Pledging

### glossary.factionwarpledging.text.intro
Each player can pledge to one of the three Sarassian factions. This pledge will stay for the remainder of the season and cannot be changed until the season is over.

Each pledge has a strength, based on the dominance score of the faction and/or the number of players already pledged to that faction. The pledge strength determines a player’s payout of Sarassian Credits at the end of each cycle. The higher your pledge strength, the more Sarassian Credits you will receive for your contribution of that cycle.

The pledge strength has no bearing on the season’s end reward, but a faction that has more players or a higher dominance score, and as such is more likely to win, will also offer a lower pledge strength. The factions will not pay you extra when they are already about to win!

### glossary.factionwar.factionwarinfluence.title
Influence

### glossary.factionwarinfluence.text.intro
Whenever a Sarassian signal has been completed, the system gains an amount of influence dictated by that signal’s tier.

Once a faction reaches 50% of the total influence in a system, it will gain ownership over that system. Additionally, it will receive a fortification bonus, making it harder for the other factions to take over that system.

At the beginning of a season, all systems will start out neutral, with equal amounts of influence for each faction.

### glossary.factionwarinfluence.title.decay
Influence Decay

### glossary.factionwarinfluence.text.decay
Influence decays over time, the rate of which is different for each tier. Decay happens for every faction and is a set amount. Nevertheless, decay can never remove the ownership of a system, even if the influence points of each faction reaches zero.

### glossary.factionwar.factionwaremitters.title
Signal Emitters

### glossary.factionwaremitters.text.intro
Key to gain contribution points and helping your faction win are signal emitters. Signal emitters are special beacons that emulate distress calls or other communications that will attract pirates and other outlaws. Once placed, a signal emitter will create a set of signal missions . For some of these emitters, the number of signals are limited, while others keep luring in more pirates until they break down.

Emitters cannot be destroyed, but they do disappear after a set amount of time.

Only players of your own faction can see and play missions generated by a signal emitter.

### glossary.factionwaremitters.title.emittertypes
Emitter Types

### glossary.factionwaremitters.text.emittertypes
There are four different emitters that can be used to generated missions.
The common emitter is the simplest one, generating one missions for you or any other faction member to complete.

The uncommon emitter generates five missions just for you to complete.

The rare emitter generates five missions every 10 minutes for 60 minutes that you or any member of your faction can complete.

The epic emitter generates 2 missions every minute for 60 minutes, also for you or any of your faction member.

### glossary.factionwaremitters.title.placingemitters
Placing Emitters

### glossary.factionwaremitters.text.placingemitters
Whenever you complete a mission generated by a signal emitter, you gain a number of contribution points and the system will gain influence points. Both are based on the tier of the mission.

When you place a signal emitter and another player completes a mission generated with it, you also receive a small amount of contribution points.

### glossary.factionwaremitters.title.emittersgameplayloop
Completing Emitter Signals

### glossary.factionwaremitters.text.emittersgameplayloop
The missions generated by an emitter are similar to the signal missions you can find throughout the Nimbus galaxy. However, they do not give specific rewards, as the main reward from each emitter mission is the influence gained.

### glossary.factionwar.factionwardominance.title
Dominance

### glossary.factionwardominance.text.intro
Each system grants their owning faction dominance points. At the end of a cycle, the total dominance points from all systems will be counted per faction and added to that faction’s dominance score.

All members of the dominant faction receive a +15% XP bonus from all sources.

Dominance score is only calculated at the end of a cycle. If a faction receives enough dominance points to make it dominant at the end of the cycle, it will not receive that bonus until the end of the cycle. The green number displayed in the faction overview is only a preview of what the faction would receive if it managed to hold all the territory it currently owns.

During each cycle, only one faction will be dominant. If there is a tie, no faction is dominant.

### glossary.factionwar.factionwarfortification.title
Fortification

### glossary.factionwarfortification.text.intro
Whenever a faction takes over a system, it receives a fortification bonus, that adds a relative amount of influence to the total influence of the system. This additional influence does not decay and is a percentage of the total influence.

For example, a fortification bonus of 15% will always make the system’s influence bar be filled by 15% for the owning faction.

This fortification does not decrease as other factions gain more influence. A fortification of 15% will always stay 15%. The only way to get rid of a fortification is to take over the system entirely.

While fortification cannot be reduced, it will naturally grow together with the system owner’s relative influence. For example, if the relative influence (without fortification) reaches 70%, then the fortification rises to 21%.

The capital system of each faction starts each season already fully under the control of their faction. This means they will naturally have a 30% fortification bonus from the start.
